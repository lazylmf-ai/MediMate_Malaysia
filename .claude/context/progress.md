# Project Progress

## Current Status

**Project State:** Documentation and planning phase  
**Development Phase:** Pre-development setup  
**Last Activity:** 2025-09-07  

## Repository Overview

- **Repository Type:** Non-git project directory
- **Primary Language:** Not yet determined (no source code files present)
- **Project Management:** Claude Code PM System initialized

## Completed Work

### Documentation Phase (Current)
- ✅ **PRD Development:** Complete 1,495-line Product Requirements Document
  - Comprehensive market analysis for Malaysian healthcare
  - User personas and technical specifications
  - Go-to-market strategy and monetization plan
  - 36-month development roadmap
  
- ✅ **Technical Architecture:** Complete 841-line Technical Implementation Guide
  - Full-stack architecture decisions
  - Database design and scaling strategy
  - Malaysian healthcare system integration plans
  - Security and compliance framework
  
- ✅ **Project Management Setup:** Claude Code PM System initialized
  - PM system configured and operational
  - Command structure established
  - Context creation system ready

### Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ **Project Structure:** Basic directory structure established
- ✅ **Claude Code Integration:** CLAUDE.md configuration file created
- ✅ **PM System:** Initialization complete with proper tooling

## Current Focus

### Active Tasks
1. **Context Documentation Creation** - Creating comprehensive project context files
2. **Architecture Planning** - Finalizing technical implementation approach
3. **Development Environment Setup** - Preparing for code implementation phase

## Immediate Next Steps

### Week 1-2 Priorities
1. **Complete Context Documentation**
   - Finish all context files (.claude/context/)
   - Establish comprehensive project baseline
   
2. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Initialize git repository
   - Set up Node.js/TypeScript backend foundation
   - Configure React Native mobile app structure
   
3. **Database Planning**
   - Finalize PostgreSQL schema design
   - Plan Redis caching strategy
   - Design data migration approach

### Month 1 Milestones
- [ ] Development environment fully operational
- [ ] Basic backend API structure implemented
- [ ] Database schema created and tested
- [ ] Mobile app foundation established
- [ ] Malaysian cultural calendar integration prototype

## Dependencies & Blockers

### Current Dependencies
- **Funding:** Need seed funding (RM 1.5M) to begin full development
- **Team:** Need to hire core technical team members
- **Partnerships:** Malaysian Pharmaceutical Society partnership pending

### Potential Blockers
- **Regulatory:** MOH approval process timeline uncertainty
- **Technical:** Healthcare system integration complexity
- **Market:** Healthcare provider adoption rate unknown

## Key Metrics to Track

### Documentation Metrics
- PRD completeness: 100%
- Technical specifications: 100%
- Context documentation: In progress

### Development Metrics (Future)
- Code coverage target: >90%
- API response time target: <200ms
- Mobile app performance target: <3s startup

## Recent Decisions

### Technical Decisions
- **Architecture:** Start monolithic, migrate to microservices
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Mobile:** React Native for cross-platform
- **Database:** PostgreSQL primary, Redis caching
- **Cloud:** AWS Asia Pacific (Singapore)

### Business Decisions
- **Market Focus:** Malaysia-first with cultural intelligence
- **Go-to-market:** Healthcare provider-led approach
- **Monetization:** Freemium with provider subscriptions

## Notes

- Project is in documentation/planning phase with comprehensive requirements
- Strong focus on Malaysian cultural adaptation and healthcare integration
- Clear path from planning through MVP to market leadership
- Technical architecture designed for healthcare-grade security and compliance
