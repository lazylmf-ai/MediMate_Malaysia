  - Circular progress indicators for daily goals
  - Weekly/monthly calendar view with completion status
  - Trend charts for adherence patterns
  - Medication-specific progress views

- **Milestone Visualization**
  - Achievement badges with Malaysian cultural themes
  - Progress milestones (7-day, 30-day, 90-day streaks)
  - Celebration animations and notifications
  - Shareable achievement cards

### 3. Provider Reporting Integration
- **FHIR Integration**
  - Leverage existing FHIR services for provider reporting
  - MedicationStatement resource generation
  - Adherence observation entries
  - Automated periodic reports

- **Report Generation**

  - Comparison views for multiple medications
  - Interactive date range selection

- **Analytics Dashboard**
  - Key performance indicators (KPIs)
  - Improvement suggestions based on patterns
  - Correlation analysis with health outcomes
  - Predictive adherence scoring

## Cultural Considerations

### Malaysian Cultural Integration
- **Celebration Themes**
  - Incorporate Malaysian festivals (Hari Raya, CNY, Deepavali)
  - Traditional motifs and colors in achievement badges
  - Culturally-appropriate congratulatory messages
  - Local language support for celebrations

- **Community Aspects**
  - Family involvement in milestone celebrations
  - Community support features
  - Cultural sensitivity in messaging
  - Respect for religious observances

## Implementation Details

### Data Models
```typescript
interface AdherenceRecord {
  id: string;
  medicationId: string;
  patientId: string;
  scheduledTime: Date;
  takenTime?: Date;
  status: 'taken' | 'missed' | 'late' | 'skipped';
  adherenceScore: number;
  notes?: string;
}

interface ProgressMetrics {
  patientId: string;
  period: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly';
  adherenceRate: number;
  streakCount: number;
  longestStreak: number;
  totalDoses: number;
  takenDoses: number;
  missedDoses: number;
}

interface Milestone {
  id: string;
  type: 'streak' | 'adherence' | 'consistency';
  threshold: number;
  culturalTheme: string;
  achievedDate?: Date;
  celebrationShown: boolean;
}
```
