## Technical Dependencies

### Shared Files and Coordination Points
Files requiring coordination between streams:
- `frontend/src/types/offline.ts` - Streams A & B (offline data types)
- `frontend/src/services/sync/SyncManager.ts` - Streams A & B (existing sync base)
- `frontend/src/utils/performance.ts` - Streams C & D (performance utilities)
- `frontend/src/models/ReminderDatabase.ts` - Stream A (existing database schema)
- `frontend/src/models/AdherenceDatabase.ts` - Stream A (existing database schema)

### Sequential Requirements
Critical dependencies that must be managed:
1. Stream A must establish offline database schema before Stream B implements full sync
2. Stream C performance monitoring integrates with Stream D resource monitoring
3. All streams must coordinate on storage budget (100MB total)
4. Integration testing requires all streams completed

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **OfflineQueueService**: Stream A extends with full data storage (not just reminders)
- **SyncManager**: Stream B enhances with conflict resolution and incremental sync
- **BatteryOptimizationEngine**: Stream D extends with storage and cache optimization
- **ReminderDatabase & AdherenceDatabase**: Stream A integrates with existing schemas
- **Performance utilities**: Stream C extends existing performance.ts

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Storage Constraints**: 100MB limit for 7-day data may be tight with cultural content
  - *Mitigation*: Implement aggressive compression, cache only essential cultural assets
- **Sync Complexity**: Conflict resolution across multiple data types is complex
  - *Mitigation*: Start with simple timestamp-based resolution, add sophistication iteratively
- **Performance Targets**: <3s launch time on low-end devices is challenging
  - *Mitigation*: Progressive enhancement, critical path first, aggressive lazy loading
- **Battery Impact**: Background sync and processing can drain battery
  - *Mitigation*: Leverage existing battery optimization, respect Doze mode, batch operations

### Platform-Specific Risks
- **Android Doze Mode**: May interrupt background sync
  - *Mitigation*: Use WorkManager for guaranteed execution, minimize background work
- **iOS Background Limits**: More restrictive than Android
  - *Mitigation*: Focus on foreground optimization, efficient background fetch
- **SQLite Performance**: May degrade with large datasets
  - *Mitigation*: Proper indexing, query optimization, regular maintenance

### Data Integrity Risks
- **Sync Conflicts**: Concurrent modifications during offline period
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive conflict resolution with audit trail
- **Storage Corruption**: Device crashes during write operations
  - *Mitigation*: Transaction-based writes, integrity validation
- **Encryption Overhead**: May impact performance
  - *Mitigation*: Selective encryption (only sensitive data), hardware acceleration
