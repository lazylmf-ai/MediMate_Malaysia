# Task: PDPA Compliance & Audit Framework

## Description
Implement a comprehensive audit logging system and data protection framework to ensure full compliance with Malaysia's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). This includes audit trails for all data access and modifications, data anonymization capabilities, automated retention policies, and consent management systems specifically designed for healthcare data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging for all database operations
- [ ] Data anonymization and pseudonymization capabilities
- [ ] Automated 7-year data retention with secure deletion
- [ ] Consent management system with granular permissions
- [ ] Data breach detection and notification framework
- [ ] Patient data access request handling (right to access)
- [ ] Patient data correction request handling (right to rectify)
- [ ] Patient data deletion request handling (right to erasure)
- [ ] Data portability features for patient records
- [ ] PDPA compliance dashboard and reporting
- [ ] Automated compliance monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Data classification and sensitivity labeling
- [ ] Encryption at rest and in transit verification
- [ ] Access control audit trails with Malaysian IC integration

## Technical Details
The PDPA compliance framework will be built as middleware layers that intercept all database operations while providing healthcare-specific compliance features:

- **Audit System**: Real-time logging of all data operations with tamper-proof storage
- **Consent Management**: Granular consent tracking for different data uses
- **Data Lifecycle**: Automated retention and deletion policies
- **Anonymization**: Healthcare-specific anonymization preserving medical utility
- **Breach Detection**: Real-time monitoring for unusual access patterns
- **Reporting**: Automated compliance reports for Malaysian authorities

Files to be created/modified:
- `/backend/middleware/audit/`: PDPA audit logging middleware
- `/backend/services/compliance/`: PDPA compliance services
- `/backend/database/migrations/`: Audit table migrations
- `/backend/utils/anonymization/`: Data anonymization utilities
- `/backend/controllers/privacy/`: Privacy rights handling endpoints

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Healthcare Database Schema Extension) - requires base tables
- [ ] Malaysian PDPA legal requirements documentation
- [ ] Healthcare-specific anonymization standards
- [ ] Encryption key management system

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 28-36 hours
- Parallel: false
