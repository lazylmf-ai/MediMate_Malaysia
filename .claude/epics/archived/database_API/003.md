# Task: Authentication & Authorization System

## Description
Implement a comprehensive authentication and authorization system tailored for Malaysian healthcare, featuring OAuth 2.0 integration, Malaysian IC validation, role-based access control (RBAC) for healthcare workflows, and multi-factor authentication. The system will support patient, healthcare provider, and administrative user types with granular permissions and Malaysian regulatory compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 authentication with multiple providers (Google, Microsoft, local)
- [ ] Malaysian IC number validation and verification
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) with healthcare-specific roles
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with SMS/email verification
- [ ] Patient self-registration with IC verification
- [ ] Healthcare provider registration with Malaysian Medical Council validation
- [ ] Session management with configurable timeouts
- [ ] Password policy enforcement with Malaysian standards
- [ ] Account lockout protection with progressive delays
- [ ] Audit logging for all authentication events
- [ ] Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities for healthcare networks
- [ ] API key management for system integrations
- [ ] Role hierarchy supporting patient, doctor, nurse, admin, pharmacy
- [ ] Granular permissions for different medical data types
- [ ] Emergency access protocols with audit trails

## Technical Details
The authentication system will be built using industry-standard OAuth 2.0 flows while incorporating Malaysian-specific requirements:

- **Authentication Service**: Centralized auth service with Malaysian IC integration
- **Authorization Engine**: RBAC system with healthcare workflow support
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with medical data protection
- **MFA Integration**: SMS/Email verification with Malaysian mobile standards
- **Provider Validation**: Integration with Malaysian Medical Council APIs
- **Emergency Access**: Break-glass procedures for medical emergencies

Files to be created/modified:
- `/backend/services/auth/`: Authentication service implementation
- `/backend/middleware/authorization/`: Authorization middleware
- `/backend/controllers/auth/`: Authentication endpoints
- `/backend/utils/ic-validation/`: Malaysian IC validation utilities
- `/backend/models/user/`: User and role model definitions
- `/backend/config/oauth/`: OAuth provider configurations

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Healthcare Database Schema Extension) - requires user and role tables
- [ ] Malaysian IC validation API or library
- [ ] Malaysian Medical Council API specifications
- [ ] SMS service for Malaysian mobile networks
- [ ] OAuth provider configurations (Google, Microsoft)

## Effort Estimate
