# Task: Core Healthcare API Development

## Description
Develop comprehensive RESTful and GraphQL API endpoints for core healthcare entities (patients, medications, healthcare providers) with integrated Malaysian cultural context. This task builds the primary API layer that mobile and web applications will consume, ensuring culturally-aware healthcare data management with proper authentication, authorization, and audit logging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Patient Management API endpoints (CRUD with cultural context)
- [ ] Medication Management API with Malaysian drug database integration
- [ ] Healthcare Provider API with clinic/hospital network support
- [ ] GraphQL schema for complex healthcare data queries
- [ ] RESTful endpoints following healthcare API standards (FHIR-inspired)
- [ ] Cultural context integration in all patient interactions
- [ ] API rate limiting and throttling implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization for all endpoints
- [ ] Error handling with standardized healthcare error codes
- [ ] API versioning strategy implemented
- [ ] Integration with authentication service (Task 003)
- [ ] Audit logging for all healthcare data operations (Task 002)
- [ ] Performance optimization for high-volume operations

## Technical Details
**API Architecture:**
- RESTful endpoints for standard CRUD operations
- GraphQL endpoint for complex queries and real-time subscriptions
- Middleware stack: authentication, authorization, rate limiting, audit logging
- Response caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- API gateway configuration for microservices routing

**Core Endpoints:**
- `/api/v1/patients` - Patient management with cultural preferences
- `/api/v1/medications` - Medication tracking with halal/haram validation
- `/api/v1/providers` - Healthcare provider network management
- `/api/v1/appointments` - Scheduling with prayer time considerations
- `/graphql` - Unified GraphQL endpoint for complex operations

**Cultural Integration:**
- Prayer time awareness in appointment scheduling
- Halal/haram medication validation
- Multi-language support for patient communications
- Cultural dietary restrictions in treatment plans
- Malaysian healthcare provider network integration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Database schema and models (Task 001)
- [ ] Audit logging system (Task 002)
- [ ] Authentication and authorization service (Task 003)
- [ ] Malaysian healthcare provider registry access
- [ ] Cultural intelligence data sources

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL (Extra Large)
- Hours: 32-40 hours
- Parallel: false (sequential after foundation tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All API endpoints implemented and tested
- [ ] Cultural intelligence integrated across all patient interactions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (sub-200ms response times)
- [ ] Integration tests passing with 95% coverage
- [ ] Security review completed with penetration testing
- [ ] API documentation published and accessible
- [ ] Load testing completed for expected user volume
- [ ] Integration with existing authentication and audit systems verified
- [ ] Malaysian healthcare compliance requirements met
- [ ] Error handling and logging comprehensive and actionable
