# Task: Security Testing & Performance Optimization

## Description
Conduct comprehensive security testing and performance optimization for the complete MediMate healthcare platform. This final validation task ensures the system meets healthcare security standards, PDPA compliance requirements, and performance benchmarks for Malaysian healthcare delivery. The task includes penetration testing, performance optimization, security audit, and compliance validation to ensure production readiness.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive security penetration testing with healthcare-specific scenarios
- [ ] PDPA (Personal Data Protection Act) Malaysia compliance validation
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment and remediation
- [ ] Healthcare data encryption validation (data at rest and in transit)
- [ ] API security testing with Malaysian healthcare attack vectors
- [ ] Performance benchmarking under Malaysian healthcare load patterns
- [ ] Database query optimization for healthcare data volume
- [ ] Caching strategy optimization for real-time healthcare services
- [ ] Load balancing configuration for high availability healthcare services
- [ ] Security audit of authentication and authorization systems
- [ ] Healthcare data access control validation
- [ ] Audit logging security and integrity verification
- [ ] Network security assessment for healthcare infrastructure
- [ ] Mobile security testing for healthcare applications
- [ ] Third-party integration security validation
- [ ] Disaster recovery and business continuity testing
- [ ] Regulatory compliance documentation for Malaysian healthcare authorities

## Technical Details
**Security Testing Framework:**
- Automated security scanning with healthcare-specific vulnerability databases
- Manual penetration testing by certified healthcare security professionals
- API security testing with OWASP API Security Top 10 focus
- Healthcare data flow security analysis
- Authentication bypass and privilege escalation testing

**Performance Optimization Services:**
- `PerformanceAnalyzerService`: System performance monitoring and analysis
- `CacheOptimizationService`: Redis caching strategy optimization
- `DatabaseTuningService`: PostgreSQL query and index optimization
- `LoadTestingService`: Healthcare load pattern simulation and testing
- `SecurityAuditService`: Comprehensive security vulnerability assessment
- `ComplianceValidationService`: PDPA and healthcare regulation compliance checking

**Security Validation Areas:**

- Healthcare provider authentication and authorization
- Medical device integration security
- Telemedicine session security and encryption
- Healthcare API rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Database security with healthcare data sensitivity levels
- File upload security for medical documents and images

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- API response times under 200ms for critical healthcare endpoints
- Database query performance under 50ms for patient data retrieval
- WebSocket connection support for 10,000+ concurrent healthcare users
- File upload/download performance for medical imaging (DICOM files)
- Real-time notification delivery under 1 second
- Healthcare data synchronization performance with external systems

**Compliance Requirements:**
- PDPA Malaysia personal data handling compliance
- Malaysian Medical Device Authority (MDA) software requirements
- MOH Malaysia health data security standards
- International healthcare interoperability security standards
- Islamic finance compliance for healthcare payment processing (where applicable)
