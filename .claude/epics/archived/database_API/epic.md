# Epic: Database API for MediMate Malaysia

## Overview

Build a comprehensive, PDPA-compliant healthcare database API that leverages existing MediMate infrastructure (PostgreSQL, cultural data services, and Docker ecosystem) to provide secure, culturally-intelligent healthcare data access. The implementation focuses on extending current capabilities rather than rebuilding, utilizing the established development environment for rapid, reliable delivery.

**Key Strategy:** Maximize reuse of existing cultural intelligence, security frameworks, and database schemas from the dev-env-setup epic while adding healthcare-specific API layers and compliance features.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Choices
- **Node.js/TypeScript Backend:** Extend existing backend infrastructure with healthcare API modules
- **PostgreSQL with Healthcare Schema:** Build upon existing cultural database with medical data tables
- **Express.js API Framework:** Leverage existing middleware and security configurations
- **Existing Cultural Services:** Reuse prayer time calculations, holiday data, and language services
- **Docker Integration:** Extend current Docker Compose setup with API-specific services
- **OAuth 2.0 + RBAC:** Build on existing authentication patterns with healthcare role extensions

### Design Patterns
- **Layered Architecture:** API → Service → Repository → Database layers for clean separation
- **Microservice Integration:** Healthcare API as dedicated service within existing ecosystem  
- **Event-Driven Updates:** Real-time sync using existing Redis infrastructure for WebSocket support
- **CQRS Pattern:** Separate read/write operations for performance and audit compliance
- **Circuit Breaker:** Extend existing resilience patterns for healthcare-critical reliability

### Infrastructure Approach
- **Database Extension:** Add healthcare tables to existing PostgreSQL cluster with cultural data
- **API Gateway:** Centralized routing and rate limiting for all healthcare endpoints
- **Audit Service:** Dedicated PDPA compliance logging extending existing monitoring stack
- **Cultural Intelligence Integration:** Direct integration with existing Malaysian cultural data services

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **API Documentation Portal:** Interactive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation with Malaysian healthcare examples
- **Admin Dashboard:** Healthcare provider management and audit log viewing interface
- **SDK Generation:** Auto-generated client libraries for mobile and web applications
- **Real-time Dashboard:** WebSocket-based monitoring for critical healthcare operations

### Backend Services
- **Healthcare Data API:** RESTful and GraphQL endpoints for medical records, medications, providers
- **Cultural Intelligence Service:** Extended Malaysian cultural data with healthcare context integration
- **Authentication & Authorization Service:** OAuth 2.0 with Malaysian IC validation and healthcare RBAC
- **Audit & Compliance Service:** PDPA-compliant logging with 7-year retention and anonymization
- **Real-time Notification Service:** WebSocket and webhook support for critical healthcare updates
- **Integration Service:** HL7 FHIR compatibility and MOH system integration endpoints

### Infrastructure
- **API Gateway with Rate Limiting:** Nginx-based gateway with healthcare-specific quotas and security
- **Database Cluster:** PostgreSQL with read replicas and automated backup for healthcare data
- **Cultural Data CDN:** Malaysian prayer times, holidays, and language data with regional distribution
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Extend existing Prometheus/Grafana with healthcare-specific metrics
- **Security Scanning:** Automated PDPA compliance checking and vulnerability assessments

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases (6-month timeline)
1. **Phase 1 (Month 1-2):** Core API Foundation - Extend existing database schema and create basic healthcare CRUD operations
2. **Phase 2 (Month 2-3):** Cultural Intelligence Integration - Integrate Malaysian cultural services with healthcare contexts
3. **Phase 3 (Month 3-4):** Authentication & Compliance - Implement OAuth 2.0, RBAC, and PDPA audit logging
4. **Phase 4 (Month 4-5):** Advanced Features - Real-time capabilities, webhooks, and HL7 FHIR compatibility
5. **Phase 5 (Month 5-6):** Testing & Production Readiness - Security testing, performance optimization, and documentation

### Risk Mitigation
- **PDPA Compliance Risk:** Automated compliance checking integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- **Cultural Sensitivity Risk:** Leverage existing validated cultural data and expert consultation
- **Performance Risk:** Build on proven PostgreSQL and Redis infrastructure with optimization
- **Integration Risk:** Use established Docker ecosystem and phased rollout approach

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Testing:** Healthcare business logic with cultural context validation
- **Integration Testing:** API endpoints with real Malaysian cultural data scenarios
- **Compliance Testing:** Automated PDPA and MOH standards validation
- **Load Testing:** Healthcare-specific scenarios with 10,000+ concurrent users
- **Security Testing:** Penetration testing for healthcare data protection
