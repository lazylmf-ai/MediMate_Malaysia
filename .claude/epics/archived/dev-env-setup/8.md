# Cross-Platform Compatibility & Documentation

## Description
Ensure comprehensive cross-platform support for Windows and Linux environments with automated documentation generation. This task focuses on platform-specific package management, automated README generation, troubleshooting guides, and thorough platform-specific testing and validation of all setup components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Windows support with Chocolatey and Scoop package managers
- [ ] Linux support for Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Arch distributions
- [ ] Platform-specific installation paths and configurations
- [ ] Automated README generation with environment-specific instructions
- [ ] Comprehensive troubleshooting guides for each platform
- [ ] Platform-specific testing suites and validation scripts
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility matrix documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking across different platforms

## Technical Details

### Windows Support
- PowerShell Core 7.x compatibility
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) detection and setup
- Chocolatey package manager integration
- Scoop package manager as fallback option
- Windows-specific Docker Desktop configuration
- PowerShell execution policy handling
- Windows Defender exclusion recommendations

### Linux Distribution Support
- Package manager detection: apt, yum, dnf, pacman, zypper
- Distribution-specific configuration paths
- Systemd service management for background processes
- SELinux compatibility considerations
- Firewall configuration (ufw, firewalld, iptables)
- Container runtime alternatives (Podman support)
- Permission and user group management

### Automated Documentation
- Dynamic README generation based on detected platform
- Environment-specific setup instructions
- Prerequisites list customized by OS and distribution
- Command examples with platform-appropriate syntax
- Screenshot automation for GUI setup steps
- Version compatibility matrix generation

### Troubleshooting Framework
- Common error scenarios and solutions database
- Platform-specific debugging commands
- Log collection scripts for support requests
- Network connectivity testing tools
- Permission and access issue diagnostics
- Performance optimization recommendations

## Implementation Notes
- Use conditional compilation patterns for platform-specific code
- Implement feature detection instead of version detection where possible
- Create abstraction layer for package management operations
- Maintain separate test suites for each supported platform
- Use GitHub Actions matrix builds for cross-platform CI/CD

## Files to Create/Modify

- `scripts/platform/linux-fedora.sh`
- `scripts/platform/linux-arch.sh`
- `scripts/docs/generate-readme.sh`
- `scripts/docs/generate-troubleshooting.sh`
- `docs/troubleshooting-windows.md`
- `docs/troubleshooting-linux.md`
- `docs/platform-compatibility.md`
- `tests/platform-specific/`
- `.github/workflows/test-platforms.yml`

## Effort Estimate
**Size:** L (Large)
**Hours:** 20-24 hours

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All setup components work on Windows 10/11 and WSL
- [ ] Setup validated on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, CentOS 8, Fedora 36+, Arch Linux
- [ ] Platform-specific package managers properly integrated
- [ ] Automated documentation generates correctly for each platform
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides cover 90% of common setup issues
- [ ] Cross-platform test suite passes on all supported platforms
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show acceptable setup times (<10 min)
- [ ] Documentation includes clear migration paths between platforms
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline validates all platforms automatically
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed on each target platform
