# Issue #33 - Stream B Progress: Background Sync Service

**Stream**: B - Background Sync Service
**Status**: âœ… Completed
**Started**: 2025-10-02
**Completed**: 2025-10-02

## Files Created

### 1. `/Users/lazylmf/MediMate/epic-education_hub/frontend/src/services/backgroundSyncService.ts`
- Singleton background sync service class
- Background fetch configuration (15-minute interval, runs on boot)
- Network connectivity listener for opportunistic sync
- Operation queue management with AsyncStorage
- Retry logic with max 3 retries
- Sync methods for progress, quiz, and achievement operations
- Queue status and statistics methods
- Full error handling and logging with [BackgroundSync] prefix

**Key Features**:
- `initialize()` - Sets up background fetch and network listeners
- `queueOperation(type, payload)` - Queues operations for sync
- `performSync()` - Processes all queued operations
- `getSyncQueue()` - Retrieves current queue
- `clearQueue()` - Clears all queued operations
- `getQueueStatus()` - Returns queue statistics
- `isSyncInProgress()` - Checks if sync is running

### 2. `/Users/lazylmf/MediMate/epic-education_hub/frontend/src/utils/syncUtils.ts`
- Comprehensive sync utility functions
- Operation ID generation with timestamp and random string
- Network connectivity checking via NetInfo
- Exponential backoff calculation with jitter
- Queue status formatting and statistics
- Operation validation and filtering
- Queue age calculation and formatting

**Key Functions**:
- `generateOperationId(type)` - Generate unique operation IDs
- `shouldRetry(operation, maxRetries)` - Validate retry eligibility
- `isOnline()` - Check network connectivity
- `calculateBackoffDelay(retries, baseDelay, maxDelay)` - Exponential backoff
- `formatSyncStatus(queue)` - Human-readable queue status
- `getSyncStatistics(queue)` - Detailed queue statistics
- `isValidSyncOperation(operation)` - Operation validation
- Additional helpers: filtering, sorting, age calculations

### 3. `/Users/lazylmf/MediMate/epic-education_hub/frontend/src/types/offline.ts` (Modified)
- Added `EducationSyncOperation` interface
- Defines sync operation structure with id, type, timestamp, payload, retries
- Coordinated with Stream A who added CachedContent types

## Implementation Details

### Background Fetch Configuration
```typescript
{
  minimumFetchInterval: 15, // 15 minutes
  stopOnTerminate: false,
  startOnBoot: true,
  enableHeadless: true,
  requiredNetworkType: NETWORK_TYPE_ANY,
  requiresCharging: false,
  requiresDeviceIdle: false,
  requiresBatteryNotLow: false
}
```

### Sync Operation Flow
1. Operation queued via `queueOperation()`
2. Saved to AsyncStorage with key `@education_sync_queue`
3. Immediate sync attempted if online (opportunistic)
4. Background sync runs every 15 minutes
5. Each operation synced via educationService methods
6. Failed operations retry up to 3 times
7. Successful operations removed from queue

### Integration with educationService
- Progress: `trackView()` / `trackCompletion()`
- Quiz: `submitQuiz()`
- Achievement: `awardAchievement()`

## Dependencies Used
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Queue persistence
- `react-native-background-fetch` - Background task scheduling
- `@react-native-community/netinfo` - Network connectivity detection
- `educationService` - Backend API calls

## Testing Considerations
- Network state transitions (online/offline)
- Background fetch triggers
- Queue persistence across app restarts
- Retry logic with max retries
- Exponential backoff delays
- Operation validation
- Concurrent sync prevention

## Coordination with Other Streams
- **Stream A**: Uses shared `EducationSyncOperation` type from offline.ts
- **Stream A**: Stream A added CachedContent types (no conflicts)
- **Stream C**: UI components will consume backgroundSyncService methods
- **Stream C**: Can use syncUtils for displaying queue status

## Notes
- All implementations are complete with no simplifications
- Follows singleton pattern from existing services
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Validates operations before processing
- Prevents concurrent sync operations
- Network-aware sync (only when online)
- Battery-friendly background fetch configuration
- Proper cleanup method for service shutdown

## Commit
- Commit hash: e90731f
- Message: "Issue #33: Add background sync service with queue management"
- Files: 3 modified/created (offline.ts, backgroundSyncService.ts, syncUtils.ts)
