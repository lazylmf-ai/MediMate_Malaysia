# Task 001: Mobile App Foundation & Authentication

## Overview
Establish the foundational mobile application architecture using React Native with Expo SDK, implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication to integrate with the existing MediMate backend, and setting up cultural profile management capabilities.

## Scope
- React Native 0.72+ setup with Expo SDK 49+
- OAuth 2.0 integration with existing backend authentication
- Cultural profile management system
- Basic navigation and state management infrastructure
- Core mobile app architecture patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. React Native Foundation
- [ ] React Native 0.72+ project initialized with Expo SDK 49+
- [ ] TypeScript configuration properly set up
- [ ] Essential dependencies installed (navigation, state management, authentication)
- [ ] Development environment configured for iOS and Android
- [ ] Hot reload and debugging capabilities functional

### 2. Authentication Integration
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 flow implemented using existing backend `/auth` endpoints
- [ ] Secure token storage using Expo SecureStore
- [ ] Automatic token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Login/logout functionality with proper session management
- [ ] Authentication state persistence across app restarts

### 3. Cultural Profile Management
- [ ] User profile creation/editing interface
- [ ] Language preference selection (Bahasa Malaysia, English, Chinese, Tamil)
- [ ] Prayer time preferences and location settings
- [ ] Family structure configuration (elderly care, children, spouse)
- [ ] Cultural calendar preferences (Islamic, Chinese, Hindu festivals)

### 4. Navigation & State Management
- [ ] React Navigation v6 configured with tab and stack navigators
- [ ] Global state management using Redux Toolkit or Zustand
- [ ] Authentication-aware navigation guards
- [ ] Deep linking support for notifications
- [ ] Proper screen transitions and loading states

### 5. Core Architecture
- [ ] API service layer for backend communication
- [ ] Error handling and loading states
- [ ] Offline support foundation (cached data, retry mechanisms)
- [ ] Push notification setup (Expo Notifications)
- [ ] App icon, splash screen, and basic branding

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
```typescript
// Core Dependencies
"react-native": "0.72.x"
"expo": "~49.0.0"
"@react-navigation/native": "^6.1.0"
"@react-navigation/bottom-tabs": "^6.5.0"
"@react-navigation/native-stack": "^6.9.0"
"@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.9.0" // or "zustand": "^4.4.0"
"expo-auth-session": "~5.0.0"
"expo-secure-store": "~12.3.0"
"expo-constants": "~14.4.0"
"expo-status-bar": "~1.6.0"
```

```

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// OAuth 2.0 Integration with Backend
interface AuthConfig {
  authorizationEndpoint: string; // Backend /auth/login
  tokenEndpoint: string;        // Backend /auth/token
  revocationEndpoint: string;   // Backend /auth/logout
  scopes: ['read', 'write'];
  additionalParameters: {
    cultural_profile: boolean;
  };
}

// Cultural Profile Types
interface CulturalProfile {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  language: 'ms' | 'en' | 'zh' | 'ta';
  timezone: string;
  prayerTimes: {
    enabled: boolean;
    madhab: 'shafi' | 'hanafi';
    adjustments: PrayerAdjustments;
  };
  familyStructure: {
    elderlyMembers: number;
    children: Array<{ age: number; specialNeeds?: string }>;
    primaryCaregiver: boolean;
  };
  festivals: {
    islamic: boolean;
    chinese: boolean;
    hindu: boolean;
    malaysian: boolean;
  };
}
```

### API Integration
Leverage existing backend endpoints:
- `POST /auth/login` - OAuth login
- `GET /auth/profile` - User profile
- `PUT /auth/profile` - Update profile
- `GET /cultural/settings` - Cultural preferences
- `PUT /cultural/settings` - Update cultural settings

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Project Setup (Day 1)
1. Initialize React Native project with Expo CLI
2. Configure TypeScript and essential tooling
3. Set up project structure and basic components
4. Configure development environment

### Phase 2: Authentication (Day 2)
1. Implement OAuth 2.0 flow with backend
2. Create login/registration screens
3. Set up secure token storage
4. Implement authentication state management

### Phase 3: Cultural Profiles (Day 3)
1. Design cultural profile data models
2. Create profile creation/editing screens
3. Implement language selection and localization foundation
4. Set up prayer time and family structure configuration

### Phase 4: Navigation & State (Day 4)
1. Configure React Navigation with authentication guards
2. Set up global state management
3. Implement deep linking and notification handling
4. Add loading states and error handling

## Dependencies
- Backend authentication endpoints (existing)
- Cultural settings API (existing)
- User profile management API (existing)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for authentication logic and state management
- Integration tests for API communication
- E2E tests for critical user flows (login, profile creation)
- Manual testing on iOS and Android devices

## Effort Estimation
**Size: M (3-4 days)**
- Day 1: Project setup and foundation
- Day 2: Authentication implementation  
- Day 3: Cultural profile management
- Day 4: Navigation, state management, and polish

## Risks & Mitigation
- **OAuth complexity**: Use Expo AuthSession for simplified OAuth flow
- **Cross-platform differences**: Test early and often on both platforms
- **State management complexity**: Start simple, refactor as needed
- **Backend integration**: Coordinate with backend team for API compatibility

## Success Metrics
- Successful authentication with existing backend
- Cultural profile creation and persistence
- Smooth navigation between screens
- 100% test coverage for authentication logic
- App builds and runs on both iOS and Android

## Notes
- This task establishes the foundation for all subsequent mobile development
- Focus on scalable architecture patterns that will support medication management features
- Ensure cultural intelligence is built into the core rather than added as an afterthought
- Prioritize user experience and accessibility from the start
