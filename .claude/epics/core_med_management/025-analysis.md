## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
Files requiring coordination between streams:
- `frontend/src/types/family.ts` - Streams A, B, & D (core family interfaces)
- `frontend/src/store/slices/familySlice.ts` - Streams A & B (state management)
- `frontend/src/services/family/FamilyManager.ts` - Streams A, B, & C (core family engine)
- `frontend/src/api/services/realtimeService.ts` - Streams B & C (WebSocket integration)

### Sequential Requirements
Critical dependencies that must be managed:
1. Stream A must establish family data models and permissions before Stream B builds dashboard components
2. Stream A must create WebSocket family channels before Stream B implements real-time updates
3. Stream C emergency system requires family relationships from Stream A
4. Stream D privacy controls integrate with family permissions from Stream A
5. All streams leverage completed authentication (#021) and notification systems (#024)

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **Mobile Foundation (#021)**: Uses established authentication, navigation, and cultural profile systems
- **Smart Reminders (#024)**: Leverages notification infrastructure, cultural scheduling, and WebSocket services
- **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Extends existing `realtimeService` with family channels and emergency handling
- **Cultural Intelligence**: Integrates with established Malaysian healthcare patterns and prayer time awareness
- **FHIR Services**: Uses existing healthcare provider integration for family care coordination

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Well-separated service directories and component hierarchies
- **Medium Risk**: Shared family state management and WebSocket message handling requires coordination
- **Mitigation**: Clear API contracts, early WebSocket message schema definition, and incremental integration testing

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: Hybrid Parallel Development with Phased Integration

**Execution Pattern**:
1. **Phase 1 (Parallel Foundation - Hours 0-3)**: Launch Streams A, C, & D simultaneously
   - Stream A: Core family management and database foundation
   - Stream C: Emergency system leveraging existing notification infrastructure
   - Stream D: Privacy framework and cultural pattern integration

2. **Phase 2 (UI Development - Hours 4-8)**: Stream B begins dashboard development
   - Stream B: Family dashboard using established data models from Stream A
   - Continue Streams C & D development
   - Stream A completes WebSocket family channel implementation

3. **Phase 3 (Real-time Integration - Hours 7-10)**: Coordinate all streams for real-time features
   - WebSocket family channels integration (Streams A & B)
   - Emergency notification integration (Streams A & C)
   - Privacy controls integration (Streams A & D)
   - Dashboard real-time updates (Stream B)

## Expected Timeline

**With parallel execution**:
- **Wall time**: 10 hours (longest stream)
- **Total work**: 32 hours
- **Efficiency gain**: 300% (4.0x speedup)

**Without parallel execution**:
- **Wall time**: 32 hours (sequential)
