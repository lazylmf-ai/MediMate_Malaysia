## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
Files requiring coordination between streams:
- `frontend/src/types/adherence.ts` - Streams A & B (core interfaces)
- `frontend/src/store/slices/adherenceSlice.ts` - Streams A & B (state management)
- `frontend/src/services/adherence/ProgressTracker.ts` - Streams A, C, & D (core engine)

### Sequential Requirements
Critical dependencies that must be managed:
1. Stream A must establish core data models before Stream B builds UI components
2. Stream C milestone engine requires progress triggers from Stream A
3. Stream D reporting uses adherence calculations from Stream A
4. All streams integrate with completed medication scheduling (#22) and reminder systems (#24)

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **Medication Management (#22)**: Leverages medication scheduling and intake tracking data
- **Smart Reminders (#24)**: Analyzes reminder effectiveness and response patterns
- **FHIR Services**: Uses existing healthcare provider integration infrastructure
- **Cultural Intelligence**: Integrates with established Malaysian cultural frameworks

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Well-separated component directories and service layers
- **Medium Risk**: Shared adherence calculation logic requires coordination
- **Mitigation**: Clear API contracts and early integration testing

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: Hybrid Parallel Development

**Execution Pattern**:
1. **Phase 1 (Parallel Launch)**: Start Streams A, C, & D simultaneously
   - Stream A: Core tracking engine and data models
   - Stream C: Cultural celebration system (independent logic)
   - Stream D: Provider reporting integration (leverages existing FHIR)

2. **Phase 2 (UI Integration)**: Launch Stream B when Stream A completes data models
   - Stream B: Visual components using established data structure
   - Continue Streams C & D development

3. **Phase 3 (Integration)**: Coordinate all streams for final integration
   - Milestone engine integration (Stream C â†’ Stream A)
   - UI component integration (Stream B â†’ Stream A)
   - Reporting integration (Stream D â†’ Stream A)

## Expected Timeline

**With parallel execution**:
- **Wall time**: 8 hours (longest stream)
- **Total work**: 28 hours
- **Efficiency gain**: 250% (3.5x speedup)

**Without parallel execution**:
- **Wall time**: 28 hours (sequential)

## Integration Points with Completed Issues

### Medication Management (#22) Integration
- **Data Source**: Medication intake records and scheduling data
- **API Endpoints**: Existing medication tracking endpoints
- **Components**: Reuse medication display components for progress context

### Smart Reminder System (#24) Integration
- **Reminder Analytics**: Analyze reminder delivery success and user response
- **Cultural Scheduling**: Leverage prayer time awareness for progress context
- **Notification Integration**: Progress milestone notifications through existing system

### Existing FHIR Infrastructure
- **Provider Integration**: Leverage established healthcare provider connections
- **Compliance Framework**: Use existing PDPA and healthcare regulation compliance
- **Data Security**: Integrate with established encryption and audit systems
