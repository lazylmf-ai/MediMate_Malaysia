# Task 006: Adherence Tracking & Progress

## Objective
Implement comprehensive medication adherence tracking with visual progress indicators, milestone recognition, and provider reporting integration to enhance patient engagement and clinical oversight.

## Scope
- Visual progress tracking with streak management
- Milestone recognition with culturally-appropriate celebrations
- Provider reporting through existing FHIR integration
- Adherence rate calculation and historical visualization
- Gamification elements for sustained engagement

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Progress Tracking System
- **Streak Management**
  - Daily, weekly, monthly streak calculations
  - Streak recovery logic for missed doses
  - Visual streak indicators with cultural motifs
  - Historical streak data preservation

- **Adherence Rate Calculation**
  - Real-time adherence percentage calculation
  - Weekly, monthly, quarterly aggregations
  - Medication-specific adherence tracking
  - Time-of-day adherence patterns

### 2. Visual Progress Components
- **Progress Dashboard**
  - Circular progress indicators for daily goals
  - Weekly/monthly calendar view with completion status
  - Trend charts for adherence patterns
  - Medication-specific progress views

- **Milestone Visualization**
  - Achievement badges with Malaysian cultural themes
  - Progress milestones (7-day, 30-day, 90-day streaks)
  - Celebration animations and notifications
  - Shareable achievement cards

### 3. Provider Reporting Integration
- **FHIR Integration**
  - Leverage existing FHIR services for provider reporting
  - MedicationStatement resource generation
  - Adherence observation entries
  - Automated periodic reports

- **Report Generation**
  - Weekly adherence summaries
  - Monthly comprehensive reports
  - Trend analysis and recommendations
  - Export capabilities for healthcare providers

### 4. Historical Data Visualization
- **Adherence Charts**
  - Line charts for long-term trends
  - Heat maps for medication timing patterns
  - Comparison views for multiple medications
  - Interactive date range selection

- **Analytics Dashboard**
  - Key performance indicators (KPIs)
  - Improvement suggestions based on patterns
  - Correlation analysis with health outcomes
  - Predictive adherence scoring

## Cultural Considerations

### Malaysian Cultural Integration
- **Celebration Themes**
  - Incorporate Malaysian festivals (Hari Raya, CNY, Deepavali)
  - Traditional motifs and colors in achievement badges
  - Culturally-appropriate congratulatory messages
  - Local language support for celebrations

- **Community Aspects**
  - Family involvement in milestone celebrations
  - Community support features
  - Cultural sensitivity in messaging
  - Respect for religious observances

## Implementation Details

### Data Models
```typescript
interface AdherenceRecord {
  id: string;
  medicationId: string;
  patientId: string;
  scheduledTime: Date;
  takenTime?: Date;
  status: 'taken' | 'missed' | 'late' | 'skipped';
  adherenceScore: number;
  notes?: string;
}

interface ProgressMetrics {
  patientId: string;
  period: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly';
  adherenceRate: number;
  streakCount: number;
  longestStreak: number;
  totalDoses: number;
  takenDoses: number;
  missedDoses: number;
}

interface Milestone {
  id: string;
  type: 'streak' | 'adherence' | 'consistency';
  threshold: number;
  culturalTheme: string;
  achievedDate?: Date;
  celebrationShown: boolean;
}
```

### Key Components
