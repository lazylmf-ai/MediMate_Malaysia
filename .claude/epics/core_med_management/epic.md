# Epic: Core Medication Management

## Overview

Build a React Native mobile application that leverages our complete MediMate healthcare API platform (65,797+ lines of code, 60+ endpoints) to deliver culturally-intelligent medication adherence for Malaysian families. The implementation maximizes reuse of existing backend services while focusing on essential mobile user experience for medication tracking, family coordination, and cultural integration.

**Key Strategy:** Frontend-only development leveraging existing backend infrastructure for rapid delivery of core medication management capabilities with Malaysian cultural intelligence.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Choices
- **React Native 0.72+** for cross-platform mobile development (iOS 12+, Android 8+)
- **TypeScript** for type safety and integration with existing API contracts
- **Expo SDK** for rapid development and deployment workflow
- **React Navigation** for cultural-sensitive navigation patterns
- **Redux Toolkit + RTK Query** for state management and API integration
- **React Native MMKV** for high-performance offline storage

### Design Patterns
- **Offline-First Architecture:** 7-day offline capability with automatic sync
- **API-First Integration:** Direct consumption of existing 60+ healthcare endpoints
- **Cultural Context Pattern:** Prayer time and festival awareness throughout app flow
- **Family Coordination Pattern:** Multi-user state management with role-based access
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Basic functionality works offline, enhanced features require connectivity

### Infrastructure Approach
- **Backend Reuse:** 100% leverage of existing MediMate API platform
- **Cultural Intelligence:** Direct integration with existing 6 cultural services
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 integration with Malaysian IC validation
- **Real-time:** WebSocket integration for family notifications
- **Compliance:** PDPA 2010 compliance via existing audit and security services

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Medication Camera Module:** Photo capture with OCR for Malaysian medication identification
- **Cultural Scheduling Engine:** Prayer time and festival-aware reminder calculation
- **Family Dashboard:** Multi-user medication oversight with real-time status
- **Offline Storage Manager:** Local SQLite with backend synchronization
- **Multi-Language Interface:** Bahasa Malaysia, English, Chinese, Tamil support
- **Voice Interface:** Voice commands for elderly user accessibility

### Backend Services (Existing - Reuse Only)
- **Medication API (existing):** Malaysian medication database and interaction checking
- **Cultural Intelligence API (existing):** Prayer times, halal validation, calendar services
- **Authentication API (existing):** OAuth 2.0 with Malaysian IC integration
- **Real-time Services (existing):** WebSocket notifications and family alerts
- **FHIR Integration (existing):** Healthcare provider connectivity
- **Audit Services (existing):** PDPA compliance and user action logging

### Infrastructure
- **Mobile App Distribution:** Google Play Store and Apple App Store
- **Push Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (Android) and APNs (iOS)
- **Offline Capability:** React Native SQLite with automatic sync on connectivity
- **Performance Monitoring:** Existing backend monitoring extended with mobile telemetry
- **Cultural Data CDN:** Leverage existing Malaysian prayer time and calendar services

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases (16-week timeline)
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Core Foundation - Authentication, medication entry, basic reminders
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Cultural Intelligence - Prayer time integration, multi-language, festival awareness
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Family Features - Multi-user accounts, remote monitoring, emergency alerts
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16):** Optimization & Launch - Performance tuning, provider integration, app store deployment

### Risk Mitigation
- **API Dependency Risk:** Existing backend is production-ready with 60+ stable endpoints
- **Cultural Sensitivity Risk:** Leverage existing validated cultural intelligence services
- **Performance Risk:** Offline-first design reduces backend dependency for core functions
- **App Store Risk:** Focus on healthcare compliance and cultural appropriateness in design

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Testing:** React Native component testing with cultural context validation
- **Integration Testing:** API integration with existing MediMate healthcare endpoints
- **Cultural Testing:** Malaysian cultural advisory board validation
- **Performance Testing:** Offline capability and battery usage optimization
- **Accessibility Testing:** Elderly user experience and multi-language validation
