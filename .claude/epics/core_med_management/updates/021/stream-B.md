## Key Features to Implement

### Cultural Intelligence Enhancements
```typescript
// Enhanced cultural profile with location-based defaults
interface EnhancedCulturalProfile extends CulturalProfile {
  locationDefaults: {
    state: MalaysianState;
    city: string;
    timezone: string;
    defaultPrayerTimes: PrayerTimeDefaults;
  };
  adaptivePreferences: {
    suggestionHistory: string[];
    userBehaviorPatterns: UserBehaviorPattern[];
    culturalInsights: CulturalInsight[];
  };
}
```

### Mobile Accessibility Features
```typescript
// Accessibility configuration for elderly users
interface AccessibilityConfig {
  textSize: 'normal' | 'large' | 'extra-large';
  highContrast: boolean;
  hapticFeedback: boolean;
  voiceGuidance: boolean;
  simpleNavigation: boolean;
  emergencyMode: boolean;
}
```

### Enhanced API Integration
```typescript
// Retry and offline handling configuration
interface ApiConfig {
  maxRetries: number;
  backoffMultiplier: number;
  offlineCaching: boolean;
  backgroundSync: boolean;
  conflictResolution: 'client-wins' | 'server-wins' | 'merge';
}
```

- Connect to Malaysian public holiday calendar
- Add support for Malaysian IC-based family linking
- Implement PDPA 2010 compliant data handling

### Backend Connectivity
- Utilize existing cultural settings API endpoints
- Enhance real-time notification infrastructure
- Leverage authentication system for family coordination
- Integrate with existing audit and security services
