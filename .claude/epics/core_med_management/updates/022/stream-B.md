## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### OCR Processing Pipeline
```typescript
// Complete OCR workflow with Malaysian cultural intelligence
import { OCRIntegrationService } from '@/services/ocr';

const ocrIntegration = OCRIntegrationService.getInstance();

// Process image with full validation
const result = await ocrIntegration.processImageWithValidation(processedImage, {
  enhanceImageForOCR: true,
  validateWithDatabase: true,
  culturalContext: {
    malayContent: true,
    halalOnly: user.preferences.halalOnly,
  },
  confidenceThreshold: 0.75,
});

// Extract medication with cultural considerations
const medication = await ocrIntegration.createMedicationFromOCR(
  result.ocrResult,
  result.databaseValidation,
  true // User confirmation
);
```

```typescript
// Cultural pattern analysis
const culturalAnalysis = await culturalRecognizer.analyzeCulturalPatterns(ocrResult);

// Results include:
// - Halal certification status with confidence scoring
// - Malaysian manufacturer identification
// - Regulatory registration numbers (MAL/DCA/MOH)
// - Cultural instruction patterns (Ramadan, prayer timing)
// - Overall cultural relevance scoring (0-100)
```

### Multi-Language Processing
```typescript
// Advanced language detection with cultural context
const languageAnalysis = await languageDetector.analyzeLanguageDistribution(text, {

  'high' // validation strength
);

// Provides detailed quality assessment:
// - Overall quality score (0-100)
// - Text coverage analysis
// - Readability assessment for medication labels
// - Specific quality issues and recommendations
```
