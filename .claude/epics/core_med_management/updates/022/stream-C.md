## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Unified Service Interface
```typescript
// Single entry point for all medication operations
import { MedicationServices } from '@/services/medication';

// Search with cultural context
const searchResult = await MedicationServices.searchMedications('paracetamol', {
  culturalPreferences: {
    halalOnly: true,
    language: 'ms',
    religion: 'Islam',
  },
  includeAutocomplete: true,
});

// Get comprehensive medication details
const details = await MedicationServices.getMedicationDetails('med_001', {
  culturalPreferences: { language: 'ms', observesRamadan: true },
  includeInteractionCheck: true,
  interactionMedications: ['med_002', 'med_003'],
});
```

### Intelligent Caching System
```typescript
// Multi-tier caching with cultural prioritization
const cacheService = new CacheService();
await cacheService.set('medication_key', data, 7_DAYS, 'high'); // High priority
await cacheService.preloadCriticalData(() => loadHalalMedications());

// Cache statistics and monitoring
const stats = await cacheService.getStats();
console.log(`Cache hit rate: ${stats.hitRate}%`);
```

### Cultural Integration
```typescript
// Malaysian-specific medication search
const malaysianSearch = await medicationSearchService.searchByCondition('demam', {
  culturalPreferences: {
    halalOnly: true,
    language: 'ms',
  },
});

// Food-drug interactions with Malaysian cuisine
const foodInteractions = await drugInteractionService.checkFoodInteractions([
  { name: 'Warfarin', genericName: 'warfarin' }
]);
// Returns interactions with kangkung, durian, etc.
```

### Redux Integration
```typescript
// Complete state management
const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
const { searchResults, searchLoading } = useAppSelector(selectSearchResults);

// Search with cultural preferences applied automatically
await dispatch(searchMedications({
  query: 'paracetamol',
  options: { halalOnly: user.preferences.halalOnly },
}));

// Check interactions with cultural considerations
await dispatch(checkDrugInteractions({
  medications: selectedMedications,
  patientProfile: { culturalProfile: user.culturalProfile },
}));
```
