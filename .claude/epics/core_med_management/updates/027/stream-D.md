## Technical Implementation

### Battery Management Architecture
```typescript
// 4 power modes with adaptive switching
- Normal: <0.21%/hour (5%/day baseline)
- Balanced: <0.17%/hour (4%/day)
- Power Saver: <0.125%/hour (3%/day)
- Ultra Saver: <0.083%/hour (2%/day)

// Features
- Auto mode switching based on battery level
- Background task consolidation
- Network request batching (15min intervals)
- Battery usage reporting with efficiency metrics
```

### Storage Management Architecture
```typescript
// Multi-tier quotas
- Cache: 50MB max
- Database: 30MB max
- Media: 15MB max
- Logs: 5MB max
- Total target: <100MB for 7-day data

// Retention policies
- Medication: 90 days (critical)
- Adherence: 60 days (high)
- Cache: 7 days (low)
- Logs: 14 days (low)
- Media: 30 days (medium)
- Analytics: 45 days (medium)
```

### Cache Management Architecture
```typescript
// 3-tier caching
- Memory: 10MB (LRU, hot data)
- Storage: 40MB (LRU, warm data)
- Persistent: 50MB (Priority, cold data)

// Eviction scoring
score = accessCount * 10 + recencyScore + priorityScore
- High priority: 3x multiplier
- Medium: 2x multiplier
- Low: 1x multiplier

// Prefetch strategies
- Morning medication prefetch (6-8am)
- Daily adherence data (midnight)
- Cultural events (Sunday/Friday)
```

### Resource Monitoring Architecture
```typescript
// Metrics tracked
- CPU: usage, throttling, cores, frequency
- Memory: total, used, peak, leak detection
- Network: type, connectivity, data usage, latency
- Battery: level, state, health, drain rate
- Performance: FPS, frame drops, render time, thread load

// Health scoring
CPU: 100 - (usage penalty)
Memory: 100 - (usage penalty)
Battery: Level-based (>50% = 100, <10% = 20)
Performance: FPS-based (60fps = 100, drops penalized)
Network: Latency-based (<100ms = 100, >1000ms = 30)
```

### Doze Compatibility Architecture
```typescript
// Doze states
- Active: Normal operation
- Idle Pending: Preparing for doze
- Idle: Full doze mode
- Sensing: Doze with motion sensing
- Locating: Brief location update

// Maintenance windows
- Scheduled every 6 hours by default
- Execute during doze idle maintenance windows
- Task types: sync, backup, cleanup, analytics
- Priority-based execution order

// Alarm strategies
- Critical: setExactAndAllowWhileIdle
- High: setAlarmClock for visibility
- Medium/Low: Inexact alarms (deferred)
```
