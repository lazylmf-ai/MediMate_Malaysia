# Task: Healthcare Database Schema Extension

## Description
Extend the existing PostgreSQL database schema with comprehensive healthcare-specific tables, integrating Malaysian cultural data and establishing the foundation for patient records, medical history, healthcare provider data, and cultural preferences. This foundational task creates the core data structures that all other healthcare functionality will depend on.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Patient records table with Malaysian IC integration and cultural preferences
- [ ] Medical history tables supporting structured and unstructured data
- [ ] Healthcare provider tables with Malaysian licensing integration
- [ ] Appointment and scheduling tables with Malaysian calendar considerations
- [ ] Medical terminology tables with Bahasa Malaysia translations
- [ ] Cultural preferences tables for dietary restrictions, religious considerations
- [ ] Medication tables with Malaysian drug registry integration
- [ ] Insurance and payment tables supporting Malaysian healthcare systems
- [ ] Database migrations created with proper rollback support
- [ ] Foreign key relationships properly established
- [ ] Indexes optimized for Malaysian healthcare query patterns
- [ ] Data validation constraints implemented at database level

## Technical Details
The schema extension will build upon the existing database structure while adding healthcare-specific entities. Key considerations include:

- **Patient Management**: IC validation, cultural data integration, privacy controls
- **Medical Records**: Structured data with Malaysian medical coding standards
- **Provider Network**: Integration with Malaysian Medical Council data
- **Scheduling**: Support for Malaysian public holidays and cultural events
- **Localization**: Multi-language support (English, Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese, Tamil)
- **Compliance**: PDPA-ready schema design with audit trail preparation

Files to be created/modified:
- `/backend/database/migrations/`: New migration files for healthcare tables
- `/backend/database/schemas/`: Healthcare schema definitions
- `/backend/database/seeds/`: Malaysian cultural and medical reference data
- `/backend/models/`: Database model definitions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Existing PostgreSQL database setup
- [ ] Malaysian IC validation library requirements
- [ ] Malaysian Medical Council API specifications
- [ ] Cultural data sources (holidays, dietary restrictions, religious practices)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and tested
- [ ] Database migrations created
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] PDPA compliance validated
- [ ] Schema supports Malaysian healthcare workflows
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Cultural data properly integrated and accessible
