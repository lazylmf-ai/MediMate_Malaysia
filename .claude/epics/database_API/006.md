# Task: Real-time & WebSocket Services

## Description
Implement real-time communication infrastructure for the healthcare platform including WebSocket services for live updates, webhook systems for third-party integrations, and real-time healthcare monitoring capabilities. This task creates the foundation for live patient monitoring, instant notifications, real-time appointment updates, and seamless integration with external healthcare systems and IoT devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WebSocket server for real-time client connections
- [ ] Real-time patient vitals monitoring system
- [ ] Live appointment status updates and notifications
- [ ] Medication reminder push notification system
- [ ] Emergency alert broadcasting system
- [ ] Healthcare provider notification channels
- [ ] Webhook system for third-party healthcare integrations
- [ ] Real-time dashboard data streaming
- [ ] Connection management with automatic reconnection
- [ ] Message queuing system for reliable delivery
- [ ] Rate limiting for WebSocket connections
- [ ] Authentication and authorization for real-time connections
- [ ] Real-time audit logging integration
- [ ] Scalable architecture supporting thousands of concurrent connections
- [ ] Integration with mobile push notification services
- [ ] Cultural context in real-time notifications (prayer time awareness)

## Technical Details
**Real-time Architecture:**
- WebSocket server with Socket.IO or native WebSockets
- Message broker (Redis/RabbitMQ) for scalable message distribution
- Connection pooling and load balancing for high availability
- Event-driven architecture for real-time data flow
- Microservices communication via real-time message bus

**Core Services:**
- `WebSocketService`: Central WebSocket connection management
- `NotificationService`: Real-time notification delivery system
- `MonitoringService`: Live patient vitals and health data streaming
- `WebhookService`: External system integration via webhooks
- `AlertService`: Emergency and critical health alert broadcasting
- `DashboardService`: Real-time analytics and dashboard data streaming

**Real-time Features:**
- Patient vital signs monitoring with threshold alerts
- Appointment scheduling and status updates
- Medication adherence tracking and reminders
- Healthcare provider availability status
- Emergency alert system with location services
- Real-time chat support between patients and providers
- Live dashboard updates for healthcare analytics

**Integration Requirements:**
- Mobile push notifications (APNs, FCM)
- External healthcare devices and IoT sensors
- Third-party healthcare management systems
- Emergency services notification systems
- Cultural intelligence for prayer-time aware notifications

## Dependencies
- [ ] Database with real-time data models (Task 001)
- [ ] Audit logging for real-time events (Task 002)
- [ ] Core Healthcare API for data access (Task 004)
- [ ] Message broker infrastructure (Redis/RabbitMQ)
- [ ] Mobile push notification service credentials
- [ ] External healthcare system API access

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L (Large)
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: true (independent service layer development)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] WebSocket server implemented with connection management
- [ ] Real-time patient monitoring system operational
- [ ] Notification delivery system tested and reliable
- [ ] Webhook system integrated with external healthcare services
- [ ] Emergency alert system tested with rapid response times

- [ ] Authentication and authorization working for all real-time connections
- [ ] Integration with audit logging system completed
- [ ] Message queuing system handling delivery failures gracefully
- [ ] Mobile push notification integration tested across platforms
- [ ] Cultural context integration (prayer time awareness) implemented
- [ ] Load testing completed for expected concurrent user volume
- [ ] Real-time dashboard streaming tested with live data
- [ ] Security review completed for WebSocket and webhook endpoints
- [ ] Documentation completed for real-time API and webhook specifications
- [ ] Integration tests covering all real-time scenarios passing
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup for real-time service health
