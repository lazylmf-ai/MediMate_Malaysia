# Task: HL7 FHIR & Healthcare Integration

## Description
Implement comprehensive HL7 FHIR compliance and healthcare system integration for the MediMate platform. This task establishes interoperability with Malaysian healthcare systems including MOH (Ministry of Health) systems, major hospital networks, and international healthcare standards. The implementation ensures seamless data exchange, compliance with healthcare interoperability standards, and integration with existing healthcare infrastructure across Malaysia.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] HL7 FHIR R4 compliance with Malaysian healthcare profiles
- [ ] MOH Malaysia health data exchange integration
- [ ] Hospital information system (HIS) connectors for major Malaysian hospitals
- [ ] Patient data synchronization with MySejahtera integration
- [ ] FHIR resource mapping for Patient, Practitioner, Organization, Encounter
- [ ] Malaysian healthcare identifier support (MyKad, passport, foreign worker ID)
- [ ] HL7 v2.x legacy system integration for older hospital systems
- [ ] Real-time ADT (Admit, Discharge, Transfer) message processing
- [ ] Clinical decision support system (CDSS) integration
- [ ] Pharmacy management system integration with Malaysian drug databases
- [ ] Laboratory information system (LIS) integration
- [ ] Radiology information system (RIS) and PACS integration
- [ ] Telemedicine platform integration compliance
- [ ] Healthcare data validation according to Malaysian health data standards
- [ ] Cross-border healthcare data exchange (Thailand, Singapore coordination)
- [ ] Islamic healthcare considerations and Halal medical practice integration
