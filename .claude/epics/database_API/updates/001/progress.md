# Task #001 Progress - Healthcare Database Schema Extension

## Assessment Completed ✅

**Stack Detected**: Node.js/TypeScript with Express.js, PostgreSQL 15, Docker ecosystem

**Existing Infrastructure Analysis**:
- ✅ Comprehensive healthcare schema already implemented in `/docker/postgres/schema.sql`
- ✅ Malaysian cultural integration (IC validation, prayer times, cultural events)
- ✅ PDPA compliance framework (audit logs, consent records)
- ✅ Core healthcare tables: users, medications, healthcare_providers, adherence_logs
- ✅ Cultural intelligence: prayer_times, cultural_events tables
- ✅ Security middleware with Malaysian healthcare compliance

## Gap Analysis

**Missing Healthcare Extensions Needed**:

1. **Medical Records & Health History Tables** - Not fully implemented
2. **Appointment Scheduling System** - Missing entirely
3. **Medical Terminology with Bahasa Malaysia** - Basic implementation only
4. **Insurance & Payment Systems** - Missing Malaysian-specific tables
5. **Enhanced Provider Network** - Basic structure exists but needs Malaysian Medical Council integration
6. **Medical Document Storage** - Missing structured storage for reports, prescriptions
7. **Emergency Contacts & Medical Alerts** - Missing critical healthcare functionality
8. **Disease/Condition Management** - Missing chronic disease tracking
9. **Vaccination Records** - Missing Malaysian immunization tracking
10. **Enhanced Indexes** - Need healthcare-specific optimization
