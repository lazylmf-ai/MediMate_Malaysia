# Setup Script Foundation

## Description
Create the core automation script infrastructure with cross-platform support for macOS, Windows, and Linux. This foundation will provide platform detection, prerequisites validation, dependency checking, and a robust error handling framework for the entire development environment setup process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cross-platform setup script that detects macOS, Windows, and Linux
- [ ] Prerequisites validation (Node.js, Docker, Git, Python)
- [ ] Dependency version checking and compatibility verification
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with actionable error messages
- [ ] Main setup entry point with command-line argument support
- [ ] Logging system for setup process tracking
- [ ] Rollback mechanism for failed installations
- [ ] Progress indicators and user feedback

## Technical Details

### Platform Detection
- Implement robust OS detection using environment variables and system commands
- Support for macOS (Darwin), Windows (various versions), Linux distributions
- Architecture detection (x86, x64, ARM)

### Prerequisites Validation
- Node.js version >= 18.0.0
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine
- Git version >= 2.30.0
- Python version >= 3.8.0
- Package managers: npm, pip, brew (macOS), chocolatey (Windows)

### Error Handling Framework
- Structured error codes and messages
- Recovery suggestions for common failure scenarios
- Exit codes that indicate specific failure types
- Graceful cleanup on interruption or failure

### Entry Point Features
- Command-line flags: --verbose, --skip-docker, --production, --help
- Environment variable configuration
- Configuration file support (setup.config.json)
- Interactive and non-interactive modes

## Implementation Notes
- Use shell scripting for macOS/Linux, PowerShell for Windows
- Create wrapper script that launches appropriate platform script
- Implement common functions library for shared functionality
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all validation functions

## Files to Create/Modify
- `scripts/setup.sh` (main entry point)
- `scripts/setup-macos.sh`
- `scripts/setup-windows.ps1`
- `scripts/setup-linux.sh`
- `scripts/lib/common.sh`
- `scripts/lib/validation.sh`
- `scripts/config/setup.config.json`
- `docs/setup-guide.md`

## Effort Estimate
**Size:** M (Medium)
**Hours:** 12-16 hours

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All target platforms can execute setup script successfully
- [ ] Prerequisites validation catches and reports missing dependencies
- [ ] Error handling provides clear guidance for resolution
- [ ] Script can run in both interactive and automated modes
- [ ] Comprehensive logging captures all setup activities
- [ ] Unit tests cover all validation and detection logic
- [ ] Documentation includes troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Manual testing completed on all three platforms
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline verified
