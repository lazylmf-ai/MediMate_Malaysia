# Docker Infrastructure

## Description
Establish comprehensive Docker infrastructure with PostgreSQL, Redis, and MinIO services. Configure service orchestration, health monitoring, network isolation, and persistent data storage for reliable development environment operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Docker Compose configuration for all required services
- [ ] PostgreSQL database with health checks and initialization scripts
- [ ] Redis caching service with persistence configuration
- [ ] MinIO object storage with bucket initialization
- [ ] Custom network configuration for service isolation
- [ ] Volume management for data persistence across container restarts
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations (dev, test, production)
- [ ] Service dependency ordering and startup coordination
- [ ] Monitoring and logging configuration for all services

## Technical Details

### Service Configuration
**PostgreSQL:**
- Version: 15-alpine
- Database: medimate_dev, medimate_test
- User: postgres with configurable password
- Port: 5432 (configurable)
- Extensions: uuid-ossp, pg_trgm, unaccent
- Health check: pg_isready command

**Redis:**
- Version: 7-alpine
- Port: 6379 (configurable)
- Persistence: RDB + AOF enabled
- Memory policy: allkeys-lru
- Health check: redis-cli ping

**MinIO:**
- Version: latest
- Ports: 9000 (API), 9001 (Console)
- Default buckets: medimate-uploads, medimate-avatars
- Access/Secret keys from environment
- Health check: mc ready command

### Network Configuration
- Custom bridge network: medimate-network
- Service discovery via container names
- Port exposure only for necessary services
- Network isolation from external Docker containers

### Data Persistence
- PostgreSQL: medimate_postgres_data volume
- Redis: medimate_redis_data volume  
- MinIO: medimate_minio_data volume
- Backup-friendly volume structure

### Environment Configuration
- Development: Full logging, auto-restart, development optimizations
- Testing: Isolated databases, fast startup, minimal logging
- Production: Security hardening, resource limits, monitoring

## Implementation Notes
- Use Docker Compose v3.8+ features
- Implement proper secrets management
- Configure resource limits for each service
- Add init containers for database migrations
- Include pgAdmin for PostgreSQL management (dev only)
- Configure log rotation and retention
- Add service startup verification scripts

## Files to Create/Modify
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- `docker-compose.test.yml`
- `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- `docker/postgres/init.sql`
- `docker/postgres/health-check.sh`
- `docker/redis/redis.conf`
- `docker/minio/init-buckets.sh`
- `scripts/docker-services.sh`
- `.env.example`

## Effort Estimate
**Size:** M (Medium)
**Hours:** 10-14 hours

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All services start successfully with docker-compose up
- [ ] Health checks pass for all services within 30 seconds
- [ ] Data persists across container restarts
- [ ] Network connectivity verified between all services
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations work correctly
- [ ] Resource usage optimized for development machines
- [ ] Service logs are properly configured and accessible
- [ ] Backup and restore procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Security configurations reviewed and hardened
- [ ] Integration tests verify full service stack functionality
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for service response times
- [ ] Documentation includes troubleshooting common Docker issues
