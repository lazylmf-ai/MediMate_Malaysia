# Mobile Development Environment

## Description
Set up a comprehensive mobile development environment for React Native with iOS and Android simulators, incorporating Malaysian localization support and cultural themes. Configure Metro bundler for optimized cultural asset loading and establish development workflows for Malaysia's healthcare context.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React Native development environment fully configured
- [ ] iOS simulator setup with Xcode integration
- [ ] Android emulator configuration with API levels 28+
- [ ] Malaysian localization framework implementation
- [ ] Cultural theme system with Malaysian healthcare context
- [ ] Metro bundler optimized for cultural assets
- [ ] Hot reload functionality for mobile development
- [ ] Device debugging capabilities enabled

## Technical Details

### React Native Setup
- React Native CLI and Expo CLI installation
- Android Studio with SDK tools and emulators
- Xcode and iOS Simulator configuration
- CocoaPods for iOS dependency management
- Gradle configuration for Android builds

### Malaysian Localization Framework
- i18n implementation with Malaysian Bahasa and English
- Cultural date/time formatting (DD/MM/YYYY, 24-hour format)
- Currency formatting for Malaysian Ringgit (RM)
- Address formats for Malaysian postal system
- Healthcare terminology in local languages

### Cultural Theme System
- Malaysian color palette integration
- Accessibility compliance with Malaysian standards
- Right-to-left text support for Arabic medical terms
- Cultural iconography and imagery assets
- Healthcare-specific UI patterns for Malaysian context

### Metro Bundler Configuration
- Asset resolution for cultural variants
- Image optimization for different densities
- Font loading for Malaysian language support
- Bundle splitting for localization resources
- Development server configuration with hot reload

## Implementation Notes
- Use React Native 0.72+ for latest features
- Implement fallback mechanisms for missing cultural assets
- Configure separate build variants for different regions
- Add performance monitoring for asset loading
- Include comprehensive error handling for device-specific issues
