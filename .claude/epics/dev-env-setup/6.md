# Backend Development Setup

## Description
Configure a robust backend development environment with Node.js and TypeScript, featuring hot reload capabilities, healthcare security tools, and PDPA compliance validation. Establish API development server with Malaysian healthcare regulatory requirements and security best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Node.js/TypeScript development server with hot reload
- [ ] Healthcare security tools integration
- [ ] PDPA compliance validation framework
- [ ] API development server configuration
- [ ] Database development setup with health data security
- [ ] Authentication and authorization development tools
- [ ] Logging and monitoring for healthcare compliance
- [ ] Development environment isolation and security

## Technical Details

### Development Server Configuration
- Node.js 18+ with TypeScript 5.0+
- Nodemon for automatic server restart
- ts-node for TypeScript execution
- Environment-based configuration management
- Hot reload for API endpoints and business logic

### Healthcare Security Tools
- OWASP dependency checking integration
- Static code analysis for healthcare vulnerabilities
- Encryption utilities for health data at rest
- Secure session management for patient data
- Input validation and sanitization frameworks

### PDPA Compliance Framework
- Data classification and labeling system
- Audit logging for all health data access
- Consent management validation
- Data retention policy enforcement
- Privacy impact assessment tools
- Cross-border data transfer compliance

### API Development Infrastructure
- Express.js with TypeScript decorators
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation generation
- Request/response validation middleware
- Rate limiting and throttling for healthcare APIs
- Health check endpoints for service monitoring

## Implementation Notes
- Use strict TypeScript configuration for healthcare safety
- Implement comprehensive error handling with no data leakage
- Configure separate environments for development, staging, and production
- Add middleware for healthcare-specific logging and monitoring
- Include database migration tools with rollback capabilities

## Files to Create/Modify
- `backend/tsconfig.json`
- `backend/nodemon.json`
- `backend/src/app.ts`
- `backend/src/middleware/security.ts`
- `backend/src/middleware/pdpa.ts`
- `backend/src/utils/encryption.ts`
- `backend/src/config/development.ts`
- `scripts/setup-backend.sh`
- `docs/backend-security.md`

## Effort Estimate
**Size:** L (Large)
**Hours:** 18-22 hours

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Backend server starts and hot reloads successfully
- [ ] Healthcare security tools scan and report vulnerabilities
- [ ] PDPA compliance validation catches data privacy violations
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly with proper validation
- [ ] Database connections work with encryption at rest
- [ ] Authentication middleware enforces healthcare access controls
- [ ] Audit logging captures all required healthcare events
- [ ] Development environment properly isolates sensitive data
- [ ] Performance testing shows acceptable response times
- [ ] Security testing completed with penetration testing tools
- [ ] Compliance validation verified against Malaysian healthcare regulations
- [ ] Documentation includes security configuration guide
- [ ] Code review completed with healthcare security expert
- [ ] Integration testing completed with frontend and mobile clients
