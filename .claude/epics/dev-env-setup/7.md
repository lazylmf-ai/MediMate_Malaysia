# Code Quality Integration

## Description
Establish comprehensive code quality tools including ESLint, Prettier, and Jest configuration with healthcare-specific rules and cultural test helpers. Implement pre-commit hooks for security and compliance validation, ensuring code quality standards meet Malaysian healthcare regulatory requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ESLint configuration with healthcare-specific rules
- [ ] Prettier formatting for consistent code style
- [ ] Jest testing framework with healthcare test utilities
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks for security and compliance checks
- [ ] Cultural test helpers for Malaysian healthcare context
- [ ] Code coverage reporting with healthcare compliance thresholds
- [ ] Static analysis for healthcare data handling patterns
- [ ] Automated vulnerability scanning in development workflow

## Technical Details

### ESLint Configuration
- TypeScript ESLint parser and rules
- Healthcare-specific custom rules for data handling
- Security-focused linting rules (no-eval, no-implied-eval)
- Accessibility linting for healthcare UI components
- Import/export validation for sensitive modules
- Malaysian healthcare terminology validation

### Prettier Configuration
- Consistent formatting across TypeScript, JavaScript, JSON, Markdown
- Healthcare documentation formatting standards
- Integration with VSCode and other IDEs
- Automatic formatting on save and pre-commit
- Cultural text formatting (dates, addresses, names)

### Jest Testing Framework
- Unit testing for healthcare business logic
- Integration testing for API endpoints
- Mock utilities for healthcare external services
- Test data factories for Malaysian healthcare scenarios
- Coverage reporting with healthcare compliance requirements
- Snapshot testing for UI components with cultural variants

### Pre-commit Hook System
- Code formatting validation
- Healthcare data pattern security checks
- PDPA compliance validation
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Test execution and coverage validation
- Cultural content validation (proper translations, formats)

## Implementation Notes
- Use Husky for Git hook management
- Configure lint-staged for efficient pre-commit processing
- Add custom ESLint rules for healthcare data classification
- Include test utilities for Malaysian healthcare workflows
- Implement code quality gates for CI/CD pipeline

## Files to Create/Modify
- `.eslintrc.js`
- `.prettierrc.js`
- `jest.config.js`
- `.husky/pre-commit`
- `lint-staged.config.js`
- `tests/helpers/healthcare.js`
- `tests/helpers/cultural.js`
- `eslint-rules/healthcare-security.js`
- `scripts/setup-quality.sh`
- `docs/code-quality-standards.md`

## Effort Estimate
**Size:** M (Medium)
**Hours:** 14-18 hours

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ESLint catches healthcare data handling violations
- [ ] Prettier formats all code consistently across the project
- [ ] Jest runs all tests with proper healthcare mock data
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent commits with security or compliance issues
- [ ] Cultural test helpers validate Malaysian healthcare scenarios correctly
- [ ] Code coverage meets healthcare industry standards (>90%)
- [ ] Static analysis reports zero critical healthcare security issues
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning integrated into development workflow
- [ ] Documentation includes code quality guidelines for healthcare
- [ ] IDE integration works properly for all team members
- [ ] Performance testing shows acceptable linting and testing speeds
- [ ] Cultural validation catches improper formatting and terminology
- [ ] Code review completed with quality assurance checklist
- [ ] Integration testing completed with CI/CD pipeline
