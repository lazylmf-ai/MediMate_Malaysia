# Validation & Health Checks

## Description
Implement comprehensive validation and health monitoring system for the development environment. This final task ensures all components are properly configured and functional through service readiness validation, automated environment testing, IDE configuration, and end-to-end setup validation with continuous health monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Service readiness validation for all infrastructure components
- [ ] Automated environment testing with comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] VSCode settings and extensions automated configuration
- [ ] End-to-end setup validation with health monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Continuous health checks with alerting system
- [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization recommendations
- [ ] Integration testing with real-world scenarios
- [ ] Automated rollback triggers for failed validations

## Technical Details

### Service Readiness Validation
- Database connectivity and schema validation
- Redis connection and memory allocation checks
- Docker container health monitoring
- Port availability and network connectivity verification
- SSL certificate validation and expiration monitoring
- External API endpoint health checks
- File system permissions and disk space validation

### Automated Environment Testing
- Unit tests for all setup script components
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Load testing for database and API performance
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Dependency version conflict detection
- Configuration drift monitoring
- Backup and recovery procedure validation

### IDE Configuration Management
- VSCode workspace settings automation
- Extension installation and configuration
- Debugger configuration for all services
- Code formatting and linting rule setup
- Git hooks and pre-commit configuration
- Intellisense and code completion optimization
- Task runner and build system integration

### Health Monitoring System
- Real-time service status dashboard
- Automated health check scheduling (every 5 minutes)
- Performance metrics collection and visualization
- Resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Alert thresholds and notification channels
- Historical trend analysis and reporting

### End-to-End Validation Framework
- Complete user workflow simulation
- API endpoint testing with realistic payloads
- Database transaction integrity verification
- File upload and processing validation
- Authentication and authorization flow testing
- Error handling and recovery scenario testing
- Performance benchmark validation

## Implementation Notes
- Use health check patterns with exponential backoff for retries
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for external service dependencies
- Create standardized health check endpoints across all services
- Use structured logging for better observability
- Implement graceful degradation for non-critical service failures
- Create runbooks for common failure scenarios
