  - Subtitle creation: 10h
**Dependencies**: none (independent production)

## Coordination Points

### Shared Resources
- **Medical reviewers**: Limited availability, shared across Streams A, B, C
  - **Resolution**: Schedule reviews in batches, 5 articles at a time
- **Translators**: May work across multiple streams
  - **Resolution**: Assign translators to specific streams to avoid context switching

### Sequential Requirements
1. **English content** must be written before translation begins
2. **Medical review** (English) should happen before translation (avoid translating errors)
3. **CMS** must be ready before content upload
4. **Translation review** by native speakers after professional translation

### Quality Gates
- English content passes medical review before translation
- Translations reviewed by native speakers with medical background
- Cultural appropriateness check before publication
- Quiz questions validated for clarity and accuracy

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Streams are independent content production tracks
- **Low Risk**: Different writers working on different topics
- **Medium Risk**: Medical reviewers may be bottleneck (limited availability)

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: parallel

**All Streams Run Simultaneously**:
- Stream A, B, C, D can all work in parallel
- Different content teams working independently
- Medical reviewer schedules batch reviews across streams

**Coordination**:
- Weekly content team meeting to sync progress
- Shared content calendar to track completion
- Centralized content repository (Google Drive/Notion)

## Expected Timeline

**With parallel execution:**
- Wall time: 12 weeks (allows for review cycles, feedback, revisions)
- Total work: 440 hours (120 + 160 + 80 + 80) across team
- Efficiency gain: Massive (4x+ speedup with proper team)

**Without parallel execution:**
- Wall time: 40+ weeks (sequential: A → B → C → D)

**Critical path**: Stream B (25 medication guides, longest content set)

```

### Translation Quality Standards

- Native speaker review for cultural appropriateness
- Medical terminology accuracy verification
- Readability testing with target demographic (60+ years old)

### Video Production Standards
- 1080p resolution, 30 fps
- Clear voiceover, moderate pace (150-180 words/min)
- Large text (24pt+), high contrast
- Simple animations (avoid rapid movement)
- Culturally appropriate imagery for Malaysia

### Quiz Development
- 5-10 multiple choice questions per content piece
- Easy to medium difficulty (accessible to elderly)
- Explanations provided for all answers
- Questions test comprehension, not memorization
- All quiz content translated to 4 languages

### Content Upload Process
1. Export from Google Docs/Word to Markdown or HTML
2. Upload via CMS admin panel (Task 35)
3. Add metadata (category, tags, ICD-10 codes, medication IDs)
4. Upload media files to AWS S3
5. Link CDN URLs in CMS
6. Preview in staging environment
7. Final QA check
8. Publish to production

### Testing & Validation
- Readability testing (Flesch-Kincaid grade 8 or below)
- Medical accuracy review by independent physician
- Translation spot-check by additional native speakers
- Cultural sensitivity review
- Beta user testing with sample content (20+ users)

### Dependency on Previous Tasks
- **Task 35**: CMS must be operational before content upload
- **Task 30**: Database schema must support content fields
- **AWS S3**: Bucket configured for media storage
- **CDN**: CloudFront configured for content delivery

### Budget Considerations
- Medical writers: ~$50-100/hour
- Professional medical translators: ~$0.15-0.25/word
- Medical reviewers (physicians): ~$100-200/hour
- Video production: ~$1000-2000/video
- Voice actors: ~$50-100/hour per language
- **Total estimated budget**: $30,000-50,000

### Legal & Compliance
- Medical disclaimers on all content
- Copyright clearance for images/videos
- PDPA compliance (data privacy)
- Medical accuracy liability protection
- Content licensing terms

### Success Metrics
- All 50+ pieces completed and published
- Medical accuracy verified (no inaccuracies found)
- Translation quality > 95% (spot-check by reviewers)
- User comprehension > 70% (quiz pass rate)
- User satisfaction > 4/5 stars (feedback surveys)

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Medical reviewer availability bottleneck
  - **Mitigation**: Contract 2 reviewers, schedule batches

- **Risk**: Translation quality issues
  - **Mitigation**: Certified translators + native speaker review

- **Risk**: Content not culturally appropriate
  - **Mitigation**: Cultural advisory board review

- **Risk**: Delays in video production
  - **Mitigation**: Start video production early (independent track)

- **Risk**: Content becomes outdated
  - **Mitigation**: Annual content review and update cycle
