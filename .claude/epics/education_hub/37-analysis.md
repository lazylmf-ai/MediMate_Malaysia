## Coordination Points

### Sequential Dependencies
1. **QA Testing** (Stream A) must pass before beta testing (Stream D)
2. **Security audit** (Stream C) must pass before production rollout (Stream F)
3. **Beta testing** (Stream D) must complete before expanded rollout (Stream F)
4. **Monitoring** (Stream E) must be operational before rollout (Stream F)

### Parallel Opportunities
- Streams A, B, C, E, G can all run in parallel during staging phase
- Stream D (beta) runs independently after QA passes
- Stream F (rollout) is final phase after all validation complete

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Most streams are independent (testing, security, documentation)
- **Low Risk**: Different teams working on different aspects
- **Medium Risk**: Bug fixes from testing may require code changes (coordination with dev team)

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid (phased parallel)

**Phase 1 - Staging Validation** (30 hours):
- Launch Streams A, B, C, E, G in parallel
- QA, performance, security, monitoring, documentation all proceed together
- Coordination: Daily standup to sync on blockers

**Phase 2 - Beta Testing** (4 weeks):
- Launch Stream D (beta program) after Phase 1 passes
- Runs for 4 weeks with weekly check-ins
- Continue monitoring (Stream E) in background

**Phase 3 - Production Rollout** (5 weeks):
- Launch Stream F (phased rollout) after beta complete
- Gradual rollout: 10% → 50% → 100%
- Active monitoring throughout

## Expected Timeline

**With parallel execution:**
- Phase 1 (staging): 30 hours (3-4 weeks, parallel streams)
- Phase 2 (beta): 4 weeks
- Phase 3 (rollout): 5 weeks
- **Total wall time**: 12-13 weeks

**Total work hours**: 120 hours (distributed across team)

**Efficiency gain**: 62% (vs. sequential testing → beta → rollout)

**Without parallel execution:**
- Wall time: 20+ weeks (sequential)

**Critical path**: Stream A (QA) → Stream D (Beta 4 weeks) → Stream F (Rollout 5 weeks)

## Notes

### QA Testing Strategy
- **Functional tests**: Test all user flows end-to-end
- **Accessibility**: Use axe DevTools, manual screen reader testing
- **Multi-language**: Test all 4 languages, verify translations render
- **Regression**: Re-test core flows after bug fixes
- **Test data**: Use realistic test data (not Lorem ipsum)

- Quarterly content effectiveness analysis
- Continuous A/B testing for feature improvements

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Beta users find critical bugs late
  - **Mitigation**: Incentivize early feedback, daily monitoring

- **Risk**: Performance issues at scale
  - **Mitigation**: Load testing before rollout, gradual scaling

- **Risk**: User adoption low (< 30%)
  - **Mitigation**: In-app onboarding, push notifications, content recommendations

- **Risk**: Security vulnerability discovered post-launch
  - **Mitigation**: Continuous security monitoring, bug bounty program
