# Stream A: Database Schema & Migrations

## Status: COMPLETED

## Summary

Created comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema for Education Hub with 5 tables, full-text search support, and proper indexing for performance.

## Work Completed

### Migration File Created

**File**: `/backend/database/migrations/009_education_hub.sql` (180 lines)

### Tables Created

#### 1. education_content
Main table storing all educational materials.

**Features**:
- Multi-language JSONB fields (title, description, content) for MS/EN/ZH/TA
- Content types: article, video, infographic, quiz
- Metadata: tags, related_medications, related_conditions
- Medical review tracking
- Publishing workflow support
- Denormalized analytics (view_count, completion_count, average_rating)
- Full-text search vector

**Indexes** (7 total):
- Category
- Published date (partial index for published content)
- Tags (GIN index for array search)
- Related medications (GIN index)
- Related conditions (GIN index)
- Search vector (GIN index for full-text search)
- Content type

#### 2. education_user_progress
Tracks user viewing and completion of content.

**Features**:
- User-to-content relationship
- Timestamps for viewed and completed
- Time spent tracking
- Unique constraint (one record per user per content)

**Indexes** (3 total):
- User ID
- Content ID
- Completed progress (partial index)

#### 3. education_quiz_submissions
Records quiz attempts and scores.

**Features**:
- Quiz answers stored as JSONB
- Score (0-100 percentage)
- Pass/fail status
- Submission timestamp

**Indexes** (4 total):
- User ID
- Quiz ID
- Passed status (partial index)
- Submission timestamp

#### 4. education_achievements
User badges and gamification.

**Features**:
- Badge ID (e.g., 'first_content', '7_day_streak', 'quiz_master')
- Earned timestamp
- Unique constraint (one badge per user)

**Indexes** (3 total):
- User ID
- Badge ID
- Earned timestamp

#### 5. education_recommendations
Cached personalized content recommendations.

**Features**:
- Relevance score (0-100)
- Recommendation reason (medication, condition, adherence, popular)
- Generation timestamp
- Composite primary key (user_id, content_id)

**Indexes** (2 total):
- User ID with score DESC (for ranking)
- Reason

### Helper Functions

#### 1. update_education_content_search_vector()
Automatically updates the full-text search vector when content is created or modified.

**Features**:
- Combines all 4 language versions (MS, EN, ZH, TA)
- Weighted search: Title (A), Description (B), Tags (C)
- Supports multi-language search queries

#### 2. update_education_content_timestamp()
Automatically updates the `updated_at` field on content modifications.

### Triggers

1. **trigger_update_education_content_search_vector**: Updates search vector on insert/update
2. **trigger_update_education_content_timestamp**: Updates timestamp on update

### Rollback Support

Included commented-out DOWN migration to rollback all changes:
- Drops triggers
- Drops functions
- Drops tables in reverse order (respecting foreign keys)

## Technical Highlights

### Multi-Language Support
- All user-facing text stored in JSONB: `{ms: "", en: "", zh: "", ta: ""}`
- Full-text search indexes all 4 languages
- Enables language-specific content retrieval

### Performance Optimization
- 19 total indexes across all tables
- GIN indexes for array and JSONB fields
- Partial indexes for frequently filtered queries (is_published, passed)
- Denormalized analytics to avoid expensive aggregations

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints to users table
- Unique constraints to prevent duplicates
- Check constraints for valid enum values
- CASCADE deletes to maintain referential integrity

### Search Capabilities
- Full-text search with tsvector
- Multi-language search support
- Weighted ranking (title > description > tags)
- Automatic search vector updates via trigger

## Integration Points

This schema enables:
- **Stream B** (Data Models & Services): TypeScript models will map to these tables
- **Stream C** (Search & Recommendation): Uses search_vector and education_recommendations
- **Stream D** (API Controllers): CRUD operations on these tables
- **Future streams**: Quiz system, progress tracking, gamification

## Next Steps

Stream A is complete and unblocks:
- **Stream B**: Data Models & Services (can start now)
- **Stream C**: Search & Recommendation Engine (can start now)

Both Stream B and C can now proceed in parallel.
