#### 7. Component Exports ‚úÖ
- Updated `/Users/lazylmf/MediMate/epic-education_hub/frontend/src/components/education/index.ts`
- Exported all new components for use in other streams

### Design Decisions

1. **Achievement Icons**: Selected culturally neutral emojis that are universally understood
2. **Language**: Used encouraging but dignified tone suitable for elderly users
3. **Achievement Conditions**: Clear, achievable milestones that encourage consistent learning
4. **Accessibility**: All components have proper accessibility labels and large touch targets
5. **Visual Feedback**: Locked badges use grayscale with opacity to clearly show unavailable state
6. **Animation**: Celebration animation is engaging but not overwhelming for elderly users

### Integration Points

#### For Stream A (Screens):
- Import `AchievementGrid` for LearningProgressScreen
- Import `AchievementModal` for achievement celebrations
- Use `gamificationService.checkAchievements()` after content completion
- Use `gamificationService.trackLearningActivity()` on content view

#### For Stream B (UI Components):
- Achievement components are ready to use
- Follow existing styling patterns (COLORS, TYPOGRAPHY)
- All components use Redux cultural state for language

#### API Dependencies (Task 31):
- Uses `educationService.getUserStats()` for progress tracking
- Uses `educationService.getUserAchievements()` for earned badges
- Uses `educationService.awardAchievement()` for awarding badges
- Uses `educationService.submitQuiz()` for quiz scoring
- Uses `educationService.getBestScore()` for quiz best scores
- Uses `educationService.hasUserPassedQuiz()` for pass status

### Files Created

5. `/Users/lazylmf/MediMate/epic-education_hub/frontend/src/components/education/AchievementModal.tsx` (290 lines)

### Files Modified

1. `/Users/lazylmf/MediMate/epic-education_hub/frontend/src/types/education.ts` - Added Quiz, Question, Badge types
2. `/Users/lazylmf/MediMate/epic-education_hub/frontend/src/components/education/index.ts` - Added exports

### Testing Notes

All services and components are ready for integration testing:
- Achievement conditions can be tested by simulating user progress
- Quiz service can be tested with mock quiz data
- Components render correctly with multi-language support
- Animations work smoothly on both iOS and Android

### Next Steps

- Stream A to integrate achievement checking in quiz completion flow
- Stream B to use achievement components in screens
- Test achievement unlocking flow end-to-end
- Verify confetti animation performance on older devices
- Connect "Share with Family" button to Task 35 when ready

### Notes

- All achievement definitions include placeholder conditions for category-specific badges (diabetes_expert, medication_expert, condition_expert) that will need backend support for category progress tracking
- Quiz structure assumes backend stores quiz questions in the content field - may need adjustment based on actual API format
- Achievement modal uses basic Animated API for confetti - can be upgraded to react-native-reanimated if needed for better performance
