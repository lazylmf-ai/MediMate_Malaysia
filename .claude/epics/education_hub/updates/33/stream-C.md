- Loading state with ActivityIndicator
- Uses offlineStorageService for data operations

### DownloadButton.tsx
Three-state download button component:
- **Download state**: Shows download icon with "Download" text
- **Downloading state**: Shows progress spinner with percentage (0-100%)
- **Downloaded state**: Shows check icon with "Downloaded" text, tap to delete
- Subscribes to download progress events via offlineStorageService.onDownloadProgress()
- Handles download errors with user-friendly Alert messages
- Differentiated error messages for quota exceeded vs download failed
- Success confirmation after download completes
- Delete confirmation dialog before removing downloaded content
- Multi-language support throughout
- Proper cleanup with unsubscribe on unmount

### OfflineIndicator.tsx
Real-time network status badge:
- Green badge with "Online" when connected
- Red badge with "Offline" when disconnected
- Shows pending sync count when offline (e.g., "Offline (3 pending)")
- Uses NetInfo for network detection
- Auto-updates when network state changes
- Polls queue status every 10 seconds when offline
- Multi-language labels for online/offline/pending
- Small pill/badge design with icon
- Proper cleanup of NetInfo listener and interval

### StorageStatsCard.tsx
Visual storage usage display:

- Progress bar showing used/total ratio
- Color-coded by usage level:
  - Green: < 60% used
  - Yellow/Amber: 60-80% used
  - Red: > 80% used
