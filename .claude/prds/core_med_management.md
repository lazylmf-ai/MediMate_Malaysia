# PRD: Core Medication Management

## Executive Summary

Core Medication Management is the primary user-facing mobile application that leverages MediMate's complete backend healthcare API platform to deliver culturally-intelligent medication adherence for Malaysian families. Building upon our production-ready infrastructure (65,797+ lines of code, 60+ API endpoints, full PDPA compliance), this mobile app provides the essential medication tracking, family coordination, and cultural intelligence features defined in the original MVP scope.

**Value Proposition:** *The mobile medication companion that helps Malaysian families stay healthy together by combining proven adherence techniques with deep cultural understandingâ€”powered by our comprehensive healthcare API platform.*

## Problem Statement

1. **Visual Medication Management** - Photo-based medication identification and tracking
2. **Cultural-Aware Scheduling** - Prayer time and festival-integrated reminders  
3. **Family Circle Coordination** - Multi-user family medication oversight
4. **Smart Reminder System** - Multi-modal notifications with cultural sensitivity
