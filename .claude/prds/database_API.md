# PRD: Database API for MediMate Malaysia

## Executive Summary

MediMate Malaysia requires a robust, secure, and culturally-aware database API to serve as the central data access layer for all healthcare operations. This API will provide comprehensive CRUD operations for patient data, medication information, healthcare providers, and Malaysian cultural data while ensuring full PDPA 2010 compliance and integration with Ministry of Health (MOH) standards.

**Key Value Proposition:** Enable secure, efficient, and culturally-intelligent healthcare data management across mobile apps, web platforms, and third-party integrations while maintaining the highest standards of Malaysian healthcare compliance.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Data Fragmentation:** Healthcare data is scattered across different systems without standardized access patterns
2. **Compliance Complexity:** PDPA 2010 and MOH requirements need consistent implementation across all data operations
3. **Cultural Context Missing:** Existing systems lack Malaysian cultural intelligence (prayer times, dietary restrictions, language preferences)
4. **Security Gaps:** No centralized security model for healthcare data access and audit logging
5. **Integration Barriers:** Third-party healthcare providers struggle to integrate with fragmented data sources

### Why This Matters Now
- Malaysian healthcare digitization is accelerating post-COVID
- PDPA enforcement is becoming stricter with higher penalties
- Cultural sensitivity in healthcare is increasingly important for patient outcomes
- Need for real-time data access for emergency medical situations
- Growing demand for telemedicine and remote healthcare monitoring
