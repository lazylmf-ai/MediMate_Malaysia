# Next Feature Suggestion: Core Medication Management System

Based on a review of the project's codebase and the detailed Product Requirements Document (`PRD.md`), the most logical and high-impact next feature to develop is the **Core Medication Management System**.

## Rationale

The PRD outlines a phased 16-week development plan, starting with foundational setup and moving into core features. The medication management system is the first major component in the "Core Features" phase (Weeks 5-6) and serves as the central pillar for the entire application. Almost all other features—including smart reminders, family circle integration, and the healthcare provider dashboard—are dependent on the user's ability to input and manage their medication list first.

Developing this feature directly addresses the primary user persona's (`Aunty Siti`) pain points of managing a complex medication schedule and understanding her prescriptions.

## Key Components for a Minimum Viable Implementation

As outlined in the PRD, the initial focus for this feature should include:

1.  **Medication Database Integration:** Allow users to search for and select their medications from a pre-populated, Malaysian-specific drug database.
2.  **Medication Scheduling:** Provide a user interface for patients or their caregivers to add a medication, set the dosage (e.g., "1 tablet"), and define the frequency and timing (e.g., "Twice a day, after meals").
3.  **Visual Medication Identification:** Implement the ability for users to upload a photo of their medication, which helps with identification and reduces errors, a key feature mentioned in the PRD.
4.  **Medication List View:** A simple dashboard or list where the user can see all their current medications, schedules, and dosages in one place.

Completing this feature will provide the foundational data structure needed to build the subsequent reminder, adherence tracking, and family sharing functionalities that are core to the MediMate vision.
