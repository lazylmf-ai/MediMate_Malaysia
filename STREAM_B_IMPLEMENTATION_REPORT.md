## Technical Architecture

### Core Features Implemented
1. **Real-time Progress Metrics**
   - Overall adherence percentage with color coding
   - Current and longest streak tracking
   - Medication-specific breakdown
   - Pattern recognition and trend analysis

2. **Interactive Data Visualization**
   - Multiple chart types (line, bar, heatmap, calendar)
   - Period selection (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
   - Interactive data points with tooltips
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes

3. **Cultural Milestone System**
   - Malaysian cultural themes (Batik, Hibiscus, Wau, Songket, Peranakan)
   - Multi-language celebration messages
   - Achievement progression tracking
   - Shareable milestone cards

4. **Family Progress Sharing**
   - Cultural respect levels (elder, peer, younger)
   - Privacy controls (basic, detailed, full)
   - Family role management
   - Automated sharing options

### Accessibility Implementation
