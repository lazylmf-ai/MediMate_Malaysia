## Research Phase

### Step 1: Gather Authoritative Sources

Use only credible, up-to-date medical sources:

**Recommended Sources**:
- ✅ Clinical Practice Guidelines (Malaysian Ministry of Health)
- ✅ WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines
- ✅ Peer-reviewed medical journals (PubMed, Cochrane Library)
- ✅ National medical associations (Malaysian Diabetes Association, etc.)
- ✅ FDA/EMA approved medication information
- ✅ UpToDate, DynaMed (clinical decision support tools)

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Wikipedia as primary source (can be used for general context only)
- ❌ Blogs, personal websites, social media posts
- ❌ Commercial health websites without clear sourcing
- ❌ Outdated guidelines (older than 5 years unless still current standard)

### Step 2: Verify Currency

- Check publication dates (prefer sources from last 3-5 years)
- Confirm guidelines are current standards of care
- Note any recent medication updates or safety warnings
- Verify ICD-10 codes are current

### Step 3: Document Your Sources

Keep detailed notes:
- Source title and URL
- Publication date
- Key facts extracted
- Page numbers or section references
- Author credentials (for medical reviewers to verify)

**Create a bibliography** for each article (stored separately, not published to users).

## Writing Guidelines

### Reading Level: 8th Grade

**Use the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level** tool to verify readability.

**Target Scores**:
- Flesch Reading Ease: 60-70 (Plain English)
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: 7-8

**How to Achieve This**:

1. **Use short sentences** (15-20 words average)
   - ❌ "Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, resulting in hyperglycemia."
   - ✅ "Type 2 diabetes happens when your body can't use insulin properly. This causes high blood sugar."

2. **Choose simple words**
   - ❌ utilization → ✅ use
   - ❌ administer → ✅ give, take
   - ❌ cardiovascular → ✅ heart and blood vessels
   - ❌ commence → ✅ start

3. **Explain medical terms** when you must use them
   - "Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose (blood sugar) move from your bloodstream into your cells for energy."

4. **Use active voice**
   - ❌ "Medication should be taken with food."
   - ✅ "Take your medication with food."

5. **Break up complex ideas**
   - Use bullet points and numbered lists
   - One main idea per paragraph
   - Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences)

### Tone and Voice

**Be**:
- Warm and reassuring (not clinical or cold)
- Respectful (acknowledge challenges of aging and chronic illness)
- Encouraging (emphasize what users CAN do)
- Clear and direct (avoid ambiguity)

**Avoid**:
- Medical jargon without explanation
- Condescending or patronizing language
- Fear-based messaging ("If you don't do X, you'll die")
- Overly technical explanations

**Example Tone**:
- ❌ "Failure to comply with medication regimens results in poor glycemic control and increased morbidity."
- ✅ "Taking your medication every day helps keep your blood sugar stable and prevents health problems."

## Medical Accuracy Standards

### Fact-Checking Requirements

**Every medical fact must be**:
1. Verified against authoritative source
2. Current as of writing date
3. Applicable to Malaysian healthcare context
4. Reviewed by licensed physician before publication

### Common Facts to Verify

- ✅ Medication dosages and frequencies
- ✅ Normal lab value ranges (mmol/L vs mg/dL in Malaysia)
- ✅ ICD-10 codes
- ✅ Symptoms and warning signs
- ✅ Drug interactions
- ✅ Dietary recommendations
- ✅ Exercise guidelines for specific conditions

### Red Flags (Require Extra Verification)

⚠️ **Be especially careful with**:
- Medication dosing instructions
- Emergency warning signs
- Contraindications (when NOT to use something)
- Allergy information
- Drug interactions
- Age-specific recommendations
- Pregnancy/breastfeeding guidance

### Malaysian-Specific Considerations

- Use **mmol/L** for blood glucose (not mg/dL used in US)
- Reference **Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines** when available
- Mention availability of medications in Malaysia
- Consider cultural dietary preferences (rice-based diets, halal requirements)
- Reference Malaysian health resources (government clinics, Malaysian Diabetes Association, etc.)

---

## Cultural Sensitivity

### Respect Cultural Diversity

Malaysia is multicultural. Consider:

1. **Dietary Practices**:
   - Halal requirements for Malay Muslims
   - Vegetarian options for some Hindu/Buddhist communities
   - Cultural food preferences (rice, noodles, roti, curry)

2. **Language Accessibility**:
   - All content in 4 languages (EN, MS, ZH, TA)
   - Avoid idioms that don't translate well
   - Use culturally appropriate examples

3. **Family Dynamics**:
   - Respect multigenerational households
   - Acknowledge family caregivers
   - Consider communication with adult children who may assist

4. **Religious Considerations**:
   - Medication ingredients (gelatin capsules, alcohol-based syrups)
   - Fasting considerations (Ramadan, religious festivals)

### Example Cultural Adaptations

**Instead of**:
"Eat a balanced breakfast with eggs, toast, and orange juice."

**Write**:
"Eat a balanced breakfast. Good options include half a cup of brown rice with steamed vegetables and fish, whole wheat roti with dal, or oatmeal with fresh fruit."

## Accessibility Requirements

### Visual Accessibility

- **Font size**: Minimum 16pt (in digital format)
- **Contrast**: High contrast text (dark text on light background)
- **Line spacing**: 1.5x for easy reading
- **Avoiding italics**: Use bold instead (easier to read)

### Content Accessibility

- **Alt text**: Describe all images, charts, diagrams
- **Screen reader friendly**: Proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- **Simple navigation**: Clear table of contents
- **Transcripts**: Provide for all video content

### Cognitive Accessibility

## Examples and Templates

### Example 1: Strong Opening Paragraph

✅ **Good Example**:

"Type 2 diabetes is a common condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose). While it's a serious condition, the good news is that it can be managed effectively with the right knowledge and lifestyle changes. This guide will help you understand what diabetes is and how to live well with it."

**Why it works**:
- Simple language (8th grade level)
- Reassuring tone ("good news", "can be managed")
- Clear purpose statement
- Defines key term (glucose)

❌ **Poor Example**:

"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and progressive beta-cell dysfunction, resulting in hyperglycemia and associated micro- and macrovascular complications if left uncontrolled."

**Why it fails**:
- Too technical (college-level language)
- Medical jargon not explained
- No reassurance or empathy
- Intimidating tone

### Example 2: Explaining Medication Side Effects

✅ **Good Example**:

"**Common Side Effects** (usually mild and go away):
- Upset stomach or nausea
- Diarrhea
- Metallic taste in mouth

**What to do**: Take metformin with food to reduce stomach upset. These side effects often improve after a few weeks.

**Serious Side Effects** (rare, but seek help immediately):
- Severe stomach pain
- Difficulty breathing
- Extreme tiredness or weakness

**When to call your doctor**: If side effects don't improve after 2 weeks, or if they interfere with your daily activities."

**Why it works**:
- Separates common from serious side effects
- Provides actionable advice
- Clear instructions on when to seek help
- Reassuring (notes common ones are "usually mild")

### Example 3: Cultural Sensitivity in Dietary Advice

✅ **Good Example**:

"**Healthy Meal Ideas**:
- Half a cup of brown rice with steamed vegetables and grilled fish or chicken
- Whole wheat roti with dal (lentils) and vegetable curry
- Rice noodles (kway teow) with tofu and lots of vegetables
- Oatmeal porridge (bubur) with fresh fruits

**Portion Tip**: Use your fist to measure one portion of rice or noodles."

**Why it works**:
- Includes foods from diverse Malaysian cultures
- Practical, culturally relevant examples
- Visual portion guide (fist method)
- Respects different dietary preferences
