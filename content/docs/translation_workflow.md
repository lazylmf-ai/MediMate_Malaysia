## Overview

MediMate's Education Hub serves a multilingual elderly population in Malaysia. All content must be available in **four languages**:

1. **English (EN)** - Source language, medical review completed
2. **Bahasa Melayu (MS)** - Malay, official language of Malaysia
3. **中文 (ZH)** - Mandarin Chinese, simplified characters
4. **தமிழ் (TA)** - Tamil, South Indian language

**Translation Philosophy**: We do NOT use machine translation (Google Translate, DeepL) for medical content. All translations are done by professional medical translators who are native speakers of the target language.

**Goal**: Provide accurate, culturally appropriate, and accessible health information that elderly users can understand and trust in their preferred language.

## Medical Terminology Guidelines

### Standard Medical Terms

Use **established medical terminology** in target language, not literal translations.

**Example (Malay)**:
- ❌ "Tekanan darah tinggi penyakit" (literal: high blood pressure disease)
- ✅ "Hipertensi" (established medical term)

**Example (Chinese)**:
- ❌ "高血糖疾病" (literal: high blood sugar disease)
- ✅ "糖尿病" (established medical term for diabetes)

**Example (Tamil)**:
- ❌ "அதிக இரத்த சர்க்கரை நோய்" (literal: excess blood sugar disease)
- ✅ "நீரிழிவு" (established medical term for diabetes)

### When to Use English Terms

**Keep in English** (with explanation in parentheses):
- Medication brand names (Metformin, Amlodipine)
- Medical abbreviations (HbA1c, mmol/L, ICD-10)
- Some technical terms without direct translation

**Example**:
- English: "Your HbA1c should be less than 7%."
- Malay: "HbA1c anda sepatutnya kurang daripada 7% (ujian purata gula darah selama 3 bulan)."
- Chinese: "您的HbA1c应低于7%（3个月平均血糖）。"
- Tamil: "உங்கள் HbA1c 7% க்கும் குறைவாக இருக்க வேண்டும் (3 மாத சராசரி இரத்த சர்க்கரை)."

### Glossary Compliance

**Always use approved glossary terms** for:
- Disease names
- Body parts and organs
- Common medications
- Medical procedures
- Symptoms

**If term not in glossary**:
1. Research term in medical dictionary
2. Verify with native speaker colleague
3. Document choice in translation notes
4. Suggest addition to glossary

## Cultural Adaptation

### Dietary Examples

**Original (English)**: "Eat a balanced breakfast with eggs, toast, and orange juice."

**Culturally Adapted Translations**:

**Malay (MS)**:
"Sarapan seimbang dengan nasi separuh cawan, ikan atau ayam panggang, dan sayur-sayuran. Contoh lain termasuk roti gandum dengan dal atau telur rebus."

(Breakfast balanced with half cup rice, grilled fish or chicken, and vegetables. Other examples include whole wheat bread with dal or boiled egg.)

**Chinese (ZH)**:
"均衡的早餐可包括半碗糙米粥配蔬菜和鱼，或全麦馒头配豆浆和鸡蛋。"

(Balanced breakfast can include half bowl brown rice porridge with vegetables and fish, or whole wheat steamed bun with soy milk and egg.)

**Tamil (TA)**:
"சீரான காலை உணவில் பாதி கப் பழுப்பு அரிசி, காய்கறிகள் மற்றும் மீன் அல்லது கோழி அடங்கும். முழு கோதுமை இட்லி, சாம்பார் மற்றும் வெள்ளை முட்டையும் நல்ல தேர்வுகள்."

(Balanced breakfast includes half cup brown rice, vegetables and fish or chicken. Whole wheat idli, sambar and white egg are also good choices.)

### Religious and Cultural Sensitivities

#### Malay (Muslim)

**Dietary**:
- Emphasize halal food options
- Avoid pork, alcohol examples
- Acknowledge Ramadan fasting

**Example**:
"If you are fasting during Ramadan, consult your doctor about adjusting medication times."
→ "Jika anda berpuasa semasa Ramadan, berbincang dengan doktor tentang menyesuaikan waktu ubat."

#### Chinese (Buddhist/Taoist)

**Dietary**:
- Include vegetarian options
- Reference traditional foods (herbal tea, rice porridge)
- Acknowledge TCM practices

**Example**:
"Some people also drink herbal tea for health. Tell your doctor about any herbs you take, as they may interact with medications."
→ "有些人也喝草药茶保健。告诉医生您服用的任何草药，因为它们可能与药物相互作用。"

#### Tamil (Hindu)

**Dietary**:
- Include vegetarian options prominently
- Reference culturally familiar foods (dal, idli, sambar)
- Respect traditional medicine (Ayurveda)

**Example**:
"Good protein sources include fish, chicken, eggs, lentils (dal), and tofu."
→ "நல்ல புரத ஆதாரங்களில் மீன், கோழி, முட்டை, பருப்பு (பருப்பு), மற்றும் டோஃபு அடங்கும்."

### Measurement Units

**Malaysia uses metric system** - keep consistent:

- Blood glucose: **mmol/L** (NOT mg/dL used in US)
- Weight: **kilograms (kg)**
- Height: **meters (m) or centimeters (cm)**
- Temperature: **Celsius (°C)**

**No conversion needed** - these are already Malaysian standards.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: No Direct Translation

**Problem**: English term has no direct equivalent in target language.

**Solution**:
1. Use descriptive phrase in target language
2. Add English term in parentheses
3. Provide brief explanation

**Example (Malay)**:
- "Pre-diabetes" → "Pra-diabetes (tahap awal sebelum diabetes, gula darah lebih tinggi sedikit daripada biasa)"

### Challenge 2: Cultural Concept Doesn't Translate

**Problem**: Western health concept unfamiliar in target culture.

**Solution**:
1. Explain concept in culturally familiar terms
2. Use analogies relevant to target audience
3. Provide context

**Example (Chinese)**:
- "Portion control" → "控制食量（每餐吃适量，不要吃太饱）" (Control food intake - eat appropriate amount each meal, don't eat until too full)

### Challenge 3: Medication Names

**Problem**: Medication has different name in target language or multiple names.

**Solution**:
1. Use generic name in English (international standard)
2. Add common local names in parentheses if different
3. Include brief description

**Example (Tamil)**:
- "Metformin" → "மெட்ஃபார்மின் (Metformin) - நீரிழிவு மருந்து" (Metformin - diabetes medication)

### Challenge 4: Maintaining Reading Level

**Problem**: Medical concepts hard to simplify in target language.

**Solution**:
1. Break into shorter sentences
2. Use everyday analogies
3. Define technical terms immediately
4. Test with native speaker elder if possible

### Challenge 5: Length Differences

**Problem**: Translation significantly longer than English (common in Tamil, Chinese).

**Solution**:
- This is normal and acceptable
- Prioritize clarity over length
- Ensure formatting remains readable
- Don't sacrifice explanation to save space

## Translation Memory and Glossary

### Translation Memory (TM)

**What it is**: Database of previously translated sentences and phrases.

**Benefits**:
- Ensures consistency across articles
- Speeds up translation process
- Reduces errors in repetitive content

**How to use**:
1. CAT tool automatically suggests matches
2. Translator accepts or modifies suggestion
3. New translations added to TM automatically

**Common TM Matches**:
- Medical disclaimers
- Warning statements ("Call ambulance immediately if...")
- Standard phrases ("Consult your doctor before...")
- Section headings

### Medical Term Glossary

**Glossary maintained** for:
- Disease names (diabetes, hypertension, etc.)
- Anatomy (heart, kidney, liver, etc.)
- Common medications (Metformin, Amlodipine, etc.)
- Symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, etc.)
- Medical tests (HbA1c, blood pressure, cholesterol)

**Glossary includes**:
- English term
- Translation in MS, ZH, TA
- Context/usage notes
- Alternative terms (if any)

**Example Entry**:

| English | Malay | Chinese | Tamil | Notes |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| Type 2 Diabetes | Diabetes Jenis 2 / Kencing Manis | 2型糖尿病 | வகை 2 நீரிழிவு | "Kencing manis" is colloquial Malay term, use both |
| Blood pressure | Tekanan darah | 血压 | இரத்த அழுத்தம் | - |
| Metformin | Metformin | 二甲双胍 (Metformin) | மெட்ஃபார்மின் (Metformin) | Keep English generic name, add local name if different |

**Glossary access**: Shared Google Sheet (all translators have edit access to suggest additions)

## Tools and Resources

### Translation Tools

1. **CAT Tools** (Computer-Assisted Translation)
   - SDL Trados
   - MemoQ
   - Wordfast
   - OmegaT (free, open-source)

2. **Medical Dictionaries**
   - **Malay**: Kamus Perubatan (Medical Dictionary)
   - **Chinese**: 医学词典 (Yīxué Cídiǎn)
   - **Tamil**: மருத்துவ அகராதி (Medical Dictionary)

3. **Online Resources**
   - [MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary](https://medlineplus.gov/mplusdictionary.html) (English reference)
   - WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)

4. **Reference Check** (NOT for final translation)
   - Google Translate (concept check only)
   - DeepL (concept check only)

### Quality Check Tools

1. **Readability**
   - Language-specific readability formulas (if available)
   - Read-aloud test (most reliable for target audience)

2. **Proofing**
   - Language-specific spell checkers
