# MediMate Education Hub: Incident Response Playbook

## Purpose
Provide a structured approach to managing and resolving incidents efficiently and effectively.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels
| Level | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| P0 (Critical) | System-wide failure | 15 minutes | Complete app down, data breach |
| P1 (High) | Major functionality impaired | 1 hour | Core feature broken, security risk |
| P2 (Medium) | Partial service disruption | 4 hours | Minor feature failure, performance issues |
| P3 (Low) | Cosmetic or minimal impact | 24 hours | UI glitch, non-critical bug |

## Incident Response Team

### Core Team
1. On-call Engineer
2. Engineering Manager
3. CTO (for P0 incidents)
4. Support Team Lead
5. Product Manager

### Roles and Responsibilities
- Immediate assessment
- Containment
- Investigation
- Resolution
- Communication
- Post-incident review

## Incident Management Workflow

### 1. Detection
- Monitoring alerts
- User reports
- Automated system checks

### 2. Initial Assessment
- Classify severity
- Gather initial information
- Determine potential impact

### 3. Containment
- Isolate affected systems
- Prevent further damage
- Activate feature flags if needed

### 4. Investigation
- Root cause analysis
- Gather technical evidence
- Document findings

### 5. Resolution
- Develop fix
- Test solution
- Implement carefully
- Verify restoration of service

### 6. Communication
- Internal stakeholders
- External users
- Transparent updates
- Manage expectations

### 7. Post-Incident Review
- Blameless analysis
- Identify improvement areas
- Update documentation
- Implement preventive measures

## Specific Incident Scenarios

### Authentication Failure
1. Immediate password reset
2. Block suspicious login attempts
3. Verify no data compromise
4. Notify affected users

### Content Delivery Issues
1. Switch to backup CDN
2. Verify content integrity
3. Restore primary delivery system
4. Monitor performance metrics

### Data Synchronization Problems
1. Pause sync mechanisms
2. Validate data consistency
3. Implement recovery procedures
4. Restore sync gradually

### Performance Degradation
1. Scale infrastructure
2. Optimize database queries
3. Implement caching
4. Monitor resource usage

## Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 1%
- Critical feature failure
- Security vulnerability detected

### Rollback Steps
1. Stop new deployment
2. Revert to last stable version
3. Restore database state
4. Verify system stability
5. Analyze rollback logs

## Communication Templates

### User Notification
"We're experiencing [brief description]. Our team is working to resolve this quickly. We apologize for any inconvenience."

### Internal Escalation
"P[X] Incident: [Brief Description]
Impact: [User/System Effect]
Current Status: [Investigation/Containment/Resolution]
Next Steps: [Immediate Actions]"
