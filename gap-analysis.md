## MediMate Gap Analysis Report

This report consolidates the previously documented findings with a fresh audit of the repository against the latest MediMate PRD (v1.3).

### Executive Summary

The codebase still diverges materially from the PRD’s MVP scope, but the nature of the misalignment is now clearer:

- **Frontend delivery is the critical blocker.** Nearly every PRD-critical patient and caregiver experience surfaces as a placeholder or isolated screen that is not reachable through the main navigation. Medication tracking, family coordination, and adherence insights therefore remain unavailable to end users despite sizeable service-layer investments.
- **Backend and service layers are extensive but unevenly usable.** There is robust TypeScript/Express coverage for medications, prayer times, cultural intelligence, notifications, and family coordination. However, important defects (for example, an invalid Redis import in the medication service) and heavy reliance on mocked integrations prevent these services from supporting production workflows.
- **Data foundation exists but is underutilized.** Contrary to the prior assessment, the Postgres schema already includes families, medication schedules, cultural profiles, and reminders. The issue is wiring those tables into working flows and eliminating mocked responses, not the absence of structure.
- **Compliance and infrastructure goals are only partially met.** PDPA services, audit logging stubs, and Dockerised dependencies are present, yet they stop short of the PRD’s expectation for automated consent handling, breach processes, telco integrations, and AWS deployment.

Without a concerted push to finish the patient-facing UI, stabilise the backend interfaces, and operationalise cultural/family features, the MVP will continue to fall short of the value proposition described in the PRD.

### 1. Core Feature Coverage

| Feature Area | PRD Expectation | Current Implementation | Gap Assessment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Medication Management (Patient App) | End-to-end medication tracker with search, intake logging, cultural adjustments, interaction checks. | `Medications` tab is a placeholder. Detailed entry flow (`MedicationEntryScreen`) exists but depends on non-existent UI components and is not linked from navigation. Backend medication APIs exist but the service mis-imports Redis and many interactions are mocked. | **High gap** – no production-ready medication experience despite substantial backend code. |
| Smart Cultural Reminders | Prayer-aware schedules, festival adjustments, multi-modal delivery, emergency escalation. | Cultural Redux slice, prayer-time APIs, adaptive reminder/ML engines, offline queue, and SMS/voice services exist but rely on simulated data and are not invoked from UI. No user interface for configuring cultural preferences. | **High gap** – services are present but disconnected; reminders cannot be configured or delivered end to end. |
| Family Circle Integration | Multi-user family profiles, caregiver dashboards, shared calendars, escalation logic. | Database tables for families and permissions exist. Caregiver dashboard and emergency contact screens are built but not exposed in navigation; notification services run on AsyncStorage mocks. | **High gap** – core UX missing; backend notification delivery not production-ready. |
| Fear-Busting Education | Localised myth-busting content, rich media, cultural success stories. | Education home screen loads but returns empty recommendation/category lists. Content services exist yet video and localisation workflows aren’t surfaced. | **Moderate gap** – plumbing exists; content retrieval and presentation need finishing. |
| Emergency & Escalation | Backup family notifications, emergency protocols, cultural sensitivity. | Emergency management screen is isolated; SMS/voice services only simulate delivery. No end-user access to escalation settings. | **High gap** – UX and actual delivery integrations absent. |
| Provider / Clinical Dashboard | Basic monitoring dashboard for pilot providers (MVP), secure messaging, alerts. | Backend includes extensive provider routes and analytics, but they mostly return mock data. No provider-facing frontend. | **Over-scoped yet ineffective** – enterprise-level APIs without usable UI or real data. |
| Compliance & Security | PDPA consent flows, audit trails, breach handling, data residency controls. | PDPA service initialises in-memory rules, and logging is wired, but consent enforcement, DSR handling, and breach workflows are not completed. | **Moderate gap** – framework in place, missing operational hooks. |

### 2. Frontend Implementation Gaps

- **Navigation holes:** `MedicationsScreen.tsx:1`, `FamilyScreen.tsx:1` and other key tabs display only placeholder text directing to future tasks. The caregiver dashboard, emergency management, and detailed education views are not registered in any navigator.
- **Missing shared components:** The medication entry flow imports `SearchableDropdown`, `ValidationMessage`, `ProgressIndicator`, and `CulturalNote` components that do not exist, so even direct routing would crash (`frontend/src/screens/medication/MedicationEntryScreen.tsx:33`).
- **Idle cultural settings:** The Redux slice and hooks for cultural preferences/prayer times are loaded on the home screen (`frontend/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx:20`) but there is no UI that allows users to edit those settings or trigger reminder generation.
- **Dead-end education content:** `EducationHomeScreen` calls mock loaders that resolve to empty arrays (`frontend/src/screens/education/EducationHomeScreen.tsx:55`), leaving fear-busting content absent.
- **Testing coverage gaps:** Playwright and axe packages are installed, yet no accessible UI flows exist to exercise. Most frontend tests focus on mocked services rather than rendered screens.

---

### 3. Backend & Service Findings

- **Medication service defect:** `MedicationService` imports `CacheService` from `../cache/redisService`, but that module only exports `RedisService`. This will throw at runtime and blocks medication CRUD (`backend/src/services/medication/MedicationService.ts:9`).
- **Mock-heavy API surface:** Provider, education, and family endpoints frequently return static mock data (`backend/src/routes/providers.ts:434`), preventing real pilots from running.
- **Notification delivery stubs:** SMS, voice, and queue services simulate provider APIs (`frontend/src/services/sms/SMSService.ts:369`) and persist to AsyncStorage, so there is no genuine telco or push integration.
- **Prayer time integration:** Routes and services exist (`backend/src/routes/prayer-times.ts:33`, `backend/src/services/cultural/prayerTimeService.ts:48`), but they rely on cached API calls without handling authentication or failure fallbacks described in the PRD.
- **Data model coverage:** The Postgres schema (e.g., `docker/postgres/schema.sql`) already defines families, medications, schedules, adherence, reminders, cultural profiles, and provider relationships. The gap lies in utilising these tables from the application layers.

---

### 4. Compliance, Security & Infrastructure

- **PDPA framework without enforcement:** `PDPAComplianceService` initialises rule sets and consent structures but does not actively intercept data processing or log consent changes (`backend/src/services/pdpa-compliance.service.ts:13`).
- **Auth and identity gaps:** OAuth and storage services mock authentication; there is no integration with Firebase Auth, SSO, or MFA despite UI prompts (`frontend/src/services/api.ts:90`).
- **Infrastructure delta:** Docker Compose provisions Postgres, Redis, MinIO, and pgAdmin, but there is no Terraform/CloudFormation nor AWS deployment pipeline, CDN, or telco setup referenced in the PRD.
- **Accessibility & security testing:** No automated accessibility scans, penetration tests, or compliance suites are wired into CI despite dependencies being present.

### 5. Key Risks

1. **User-facing functionality remains incomplete.** Without a working medication or family experience, the MVP cannot deliver the promised 30% adherence lift or family coordination benefits.
2. **Service instability and mocks jeopardise pilots.** Mocked provider data, simulation-only reminders, and the Redis import bug will cause production rollouts to fail even if the UI is finished.
3. **Regulatory exposure.** PDPA tooling is not hooked into real consent or breach processes, risking non-compliance during pilots with healthcare partners.
4. **Engineering focus drift.** Continuing to expand complex backend features (FHIR, analytics, ML) without shipping the base app deepens the misalignment highlighted in both analyses.

### 6. Phased Action Plan

This action plan operationalizes the analysis findings into a concrete, three-phase approach to deliver the MVP.

---

#### **Phase 1: Stabilize the Foundation & Unblock Development**

This phase focuses on fixing critical backend issues and wiring up the basic frontend structure to create a stable platform for feature development.

1.  **Stabilize Backend Services:**
    *   **Fix Critical Defects:** Immediately address blocking bugs, starting with the **Redis import error in `MedicationService`**.
    *   **Remove Mock Data:** Systematically replace static mock data in key backend APIs (e.g., providers, education, family) with live database queries.
    *   **Connect Notification Services:** Replace temporary `AsyncStorage` mocks for notifications with actual backend service integrations.

2.  **Structure the Frontend Application:**
    *   **Implement Navigation Stacks:** For the "Medications" and "Family" tabs, create dedicated stack navigators to handle navigation to sub-screens.
    *   **Replace Placeholder Screens:**
        *   **Medications:** Replace the placeholder `MedicationsScreen` with a functional component that includes a list view and a button to navigate to the `MedicationEntryScreen`.
        *   **Family:** Replace the placeholder `FamilyScreen` with the existing `CaregiverDashboard.tsx` component.
    *   **Create Missing UI Components:** Build basic versions of the missing shared components (`SearchableDropdown`, `ValidationMessage`, etc.) to allow `MedicationEntryScreen` to render.

---

#### **Phase 2: Implement Core MVP User Journeys**

With a stable foundation, this phase focuses on building the end-to-end user experiences that deliver the core value proposition.

1.  **Complete the Medication Management Flow:**
    *   **Display Medication Data:** Connect the medication list view to the backend to fetch and display the user's actual medications.
    *   **Enable Medication Creation:** Ensure the `MedicationEntryScreen` can successfully create new medication records via the backend API.
    *   **Build Detail & Logging View:** Create a screen where users can view medication details and log their adherence.

2.  **Build the Family Circle Experience:**
    *   **Connect the Caregiver Dashboard:** Wire the `CaregiverDashboard` to fetch and display real-time adherence data for connected family members.
    *   **Implement Family Invitations:** Build the UI and logic for users to invite family members.
    *   **Surface Emergency Settings:** Make the `EmergencyContactManagement` screen accessible from the UI.

3.  **Operationalize Cultural Intelligence:**
    *   **Create Cultural Settings UI:** Build a dedicated screen for users to set their language, prayer times, and festival preferences.
    *   **Persist Preferences:** Ensure these settings are saved to the user's profile in the database.
    *   **Trigger Reminder Generation:** Confirm that saving these preferences correctly triggers the backend's culturally-aware reminder scheduling engine.

---

#### **Phase 3: Prepare for Pilot Launch**

This final phase addresses the operational requirements needed to launch a pilot with real users.

1.  **Activate Notification Delivery:**
    *   **Integrate Push Notifications:** Connect the frontend to a real push notification service (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging).
    *   **Integrate SMS Delivery:** Connect the backend to a third-party SMS provider for reliable delivery.

2.  **Implement Compliance and Security:**
    *   **Enforce PDPA Consent:** Integrate the `PDPAComplianceService` into the user registration flow to capture and log user consent.
    *   **Integrate Real Authentication:** Replace all mock authentication logic with a full integration to Firebase Auth.

3.  **Final Polish and Review:**
    *   **Confirm Scope:** Formally defer the provider dashboard to focus all resources on the patient and family MVP.
    *   **Load Real Content:** Connect the `EducationHomeScreen` to the backend to fetch actual educational content.
    *   **End-to-End Testing:** Perform testing of the completed user journeys to ensure they are pilot-ready.

### Conclusion

MediMate’s repository houses impressive groundwork—rich data models, cultural services, and notification engines—but the lack of connected, user-facing functionality leaves the MVP promise unfulfilled. Prioritising completion of the medication, cultural reminder, and family coordination journeys, while hardening the underlying services, will produce the fastest progress toward the PRD vision. Continued investment in advanced clinical features without shipping these basics risks further delay and stakeholder frustration.
